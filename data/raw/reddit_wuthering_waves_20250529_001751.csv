reddit_1kwm9ka,Rover is not a self-insert here’s why. Artist: @aaapair (image),"Rover is not a self-insert, even if it might have seemed that way at first. But as the story progresses, it becomes clear that this is definitely not the case.He has his own goals, his own backstory, and makes his own decisions. All of this clearly sets him apart from the concept of a self-insert.
Rover doesn’t blindly follow quest directions  he’s not just a delivery guy. He makes his own choices, as we can see in updates( 1.0, 1.1, 1.3, 2.0, 2.2, and especially in the Ciaccona quest 2.3).

Even when we get to make dialogue choices, they actually matter. Unlike other gacha games where your choices don’t change a thing and the characters always respond the same way, in WuWa, dialogue really does change. It’s refreshing to see a game where your decisions can lead to bonus scenes — some of them amazing  that you can completely miss if you don’t pick the right option. That’s what real interaction feels like: you can’t see everything in one run, and it makes the experience feel much more genuine.

For example, a lot of players missed the chance to get a headpat from Zani( me too lol), or didn’t get Canterella’s marriage proposal just because of different choices. And there are plenty more moments like that. Since version 2.0, hidden dialogue like this has become more frequent. And since you can’t go back, it makes everything even funnier. But it’s never frustrating, because it’s all coherent: every player makes different decisions, and the journey feels personal.

Rover always has his own personality. And we, as players, have no control over some major decisions  like during the Aura farming for example.

The MC already has a major influence on the world, due to his past as the Lord of the Arbiters. Right now, we’re following a Rover who must surpass his former self — an aspect that hasn’t been fully explored yet, but it’s clear the game will develop it further later on.

And of course, as the protagonist, he naturally earns some affection from other characters  which makes sense. In real life, if someone is reliable, kind, and someone you can count on, they’ll naturally be appreciated. Sure, it can be exhausting sometimes, but it’s not unrealistic and in the game, that aspect is becoming less present, which is actually nice.

The gathering wives running joke will always be hilarious, but that doesn’t change the fact that Rover is not a self-insert.

Wuthering Waves really stands out because of all this. For example, Traveler in GSH can easily be seen as a light self insert. The MC from Tower of Fantasy is basically the blueprint of a self-insert

So, what do you think?

reddit_1kxkjf3,Game and Reddit appreciation post,"Just wanted to say that WuWa is, in my eyes, the best Gacha Game I have tried so far. This might be quite subjective, but I believe that many of my reasons resonate with other players. Coming straight from Genshin, WuWa did many things better, for me at least. I prefer the more mature style and characters, the deeper combat system and the way the story is presented. Regarding that third point, I also really enjoy the skip button. The skip button was, for some reason, a controversial topic in the Genshin community (unsure how it is perceived here). I never understood why it is bad to have more options. Genshin sometimes had interesting topics in the story but the way it was told was terrible and I utterly hatted Paimon. So why not let people who are only there for the gameplay skip that? Most of the time I just let it play out while watching something on my second monitor and I don't know if that is better than a skip button. Anyway, enough ranting about Genshin. WuWa was the first Gacha where I actively followed the story and its characters. I might have skipped a fair amount at first but ever since I came to Rinascita I paid attention to almost every side story. Even though I do agree with some criticism, not enough reoccurring side characters, too much of a focus on ""wifeable"" companions, etc, it is still a really solid experience. Therefore, I also agree with the notion that too much whining will also do no good. The gameplay is fun, the characters are endearing, and the world is interesting. I also still have high hopes that the more the character roster grows, the more some characters might reappear.

Another thing is, I actually think that the Reddit is quite nice. I have to add that I do not go through each and every post, but the ones that do pop up are either quite funny or informative, aside from the occasional outcry of frustration. To me, a casual Reddit user, the community seems quite pleasant.

So yeah, that was pretty much all. Basically, I just wanted to call out what I believe to be good, so that frustration posts do not construe a false image of the player base.

# MONTHLY MEGATHREAD

**Welcome to our regular pinned Megathread!**

While many topics are allowed as standalone submissions, others that tend to be lower-effort, less notable, or easily answered belong in this thread instead. These include simple questions such as those related to receiving game assistance, game recommendation requests or help finding a specific game, and other general discussions that don't warrant a dedicated thread or aren't directly related to gacha gaming (provided they are not Banned Content).

Some specific examples of what these megathreads should be used for include:

* Help remembering an old gacha game, or finding a new one to start playing
* Recommendations for the best emulator to use on your device
* Receiving updates on how ongoing games are doing from current players (“How is \[game\] doing these days?”)
* Learning what people’s favorite games or types of games are, as well as how others feel about a particular game feature, event, monetization strategy, etc. in specific games
* Getting clarification on what confusing or game-specific abbreviations mean
* Finding where people learn about games or like to get their news and information from
* Discovering new content creators that other Summoners watch or recommend
* Asking for any sort of general advice relating to gacha games at all
* Discussing other topics that are only indirectly related to gacha, such as subreddit meta or industry happenings

Generally, anything asking a question or requiring the opinions of others belongs here. We have many veteran Summoners who are happy to share their opinions and answers, or discuss the topics you may be interested in!

If you want to contribute, please first read the request or question thoroughly, before making sure not to recommend something already tried or provide the same advice as a previous comment left in response. Please also reply as neutrally as possible, without bashing games or arguing with others in the community– this is not about winning or losing, but sharing useful information that helps out another member. Replies should include the full names of anything mentioned, as new Summoners may not know what “GI”, “FGO”, or even “F2P” means. Even if they do, it's still helpful so that the results are easily searchable and others who aren't the OP can better follow along.

As a general reminder, both Reddiquette and all of our Subreddit Rules still apply here. Make sure to keep things respectful! Religious or political topics, sharing personal information, and other rule-breaking behavior are banned. Accounts involved in sharing these may be subject to disciplinary action at moderator discretion.

With that said, feel free to discuss whatever here and make acquaintance with your friendly gacha gaming neighbors!

reddit_1kw36ql,Limbus has another (dumb) controversy,"Figured id make a post now, before it gets bigger (hopefully not)

For this to make any sense id have to explain a little bit about the game mechanics. Basically, there is a status effect in the game called ""rupture"". You build up stacks of rupture on an enemy, then on-attack, you trigger them which deals True damage (ignoring all resistances). This is obviously very strong, but so far has been very balanced.....sortof.

There is one outlier, Red sheet sinclair. This unit is only a 2\*\* identity and by all means should be kinda weak, and it is! His kit is very mediocre as expected....however that is with the exception of his bench passive. Any unit you dont bring directly into battle can be ""benched"" instead, where they will provide a unique bench passive effect for your fight without actually being in the fight themselves. Red sheet sinclair gives your allies a stupidly strong status effect which allows them to build rupture up crazy fast on enemies, red sheet sinclair was THE rupture unit to have, if you werent benching them, you werent playing rutpure correctly.

So far this was mostly fine, but we did notice alot of identities being released with odd conditions on their skills, obviously made to prevent red sheet sinclair from making them overpowered. You would see alot of units say something along the lines of ""if the enemy has 3 stacks of 15 potency rupture on them, this unit cannot apply more rupture to them but instead gets some kind of buff like damage up or defense up""

So, everyone is lowkey worried about red sheet sinclair, but so far the dam hasn't broken. We managed to go on for quite a while with no id really destroying the game completely with rupture yet.

That is, until the newest id came out MAO FAUST. This unit, quite frankly, is overpowered. Not even regarding rupture, but just in general, this unit is NUTS. I cant go into her kit bc its complicated, but just on her own, without any sinclair to help her, shes already a crazy good unit, she just so happens to also be a rupture unit which means both of them combined create a balance nightmare.

So, the dam finally had cracks in it and something def needed to be done, so the director makes an announcement to nerf both red sheet sinclair and mao faust, but give everyone compensation (quite frankly, the compensation was really really high, were are talking 1300 currency + free 3\* 10 pull + everything you used to pull Mao faust would be refunded for free + 300 crates)

And then here come the death threats from a certain region of the world, notable examples include things like: 

""Are you eating your own words as shit? Kim Ji-hoon, the dog that will die, wait for the suicide truck to explode in front of your company."" -translated quote from some asshole on twitter

You get the picture, i really dont wanna post more of those.

So seeing the backlash from a very loud part of the region, the nerfs are cancelled and they apologize for wanting to balance some frankly overdue identities. But this then causes ANTOHER backlash because, as fate would have it, when they announced they would compensate people for nerfing the new Mao faust identity, a bunch of people who didnt even own her, started rapidly pulling for her so they could also partake in the compensation rewards and basically get Mao faust for free since all resources used would be refunded.

Now there is a mini review bomb happening on steam (its not as big as the previous one atm, but things could get worse) but there are also alot of people here in the west who actually wanted the nerfs to go through, positive review bombing the game to counteract the negative review bomb, and thats where we are at right now.

TLDR: Director wants to nerf 2 overpowered identities and promises compensation for anyone who pulled the new id, eastern players livid and send death threats, western players mostly alright with it. Small part of the playerbase decides they wanna take advantage of this compensation so they start pulling for the new identity so they can partake in it. Nerfs are canceled due to backlash, now all those who wanted the compensation are upset they spend their resources on pulls.",639,278,1748287680.0,gachagaming,Naddition_Reddit,0.89,https://reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1kw36ql/limbus_has_another_dumb_controversy/

reddit_1ku7h1e,Does China (Chinese Government) really have rules against depicting dark skinned characters in Gacha games (or video games in general) within certain parameters that other characters are not subject to? Or is this misinfo (Context inside),"So Context: As we all know Nikke is having a huge controversy atm regarding the new CN Version of their game. One notable change in the CN version is the supposed removal of a good chunk of  (if not a majority or all) Dark Skinned Characters in the Chinese Release of the game (Which I recall has only happened 1 other time in FGO with Demiya and not to this extent of deleting them). This lead to several ppl making statements on why this has happened and generally I see two ideas pop up on the Nikke subreddit (Listed below). 

1.) This is a rule by the government that Shift Up has to comply with. Basically they are being forced to remove Dark Skinned characters because of rules setup by the Chinese Government so their game can launch/be played in China. Thus to even operate in China and make any money at all, these characters need to be removed. 

2.) They are doing this to cater to the Chinese audience (but are not being forced to do so by the Government). So basically they are voluntarily removing the dark skinned characters from their game because they believe in doing so it will be better received in China (and thus make more money) for whatever reason. Thus they are doing this to cater to such tastes of their own free will without being forced to. 

Now I am curious, Is #1 True where Chinese game companies are forced to remove Dark Skinned characters from their games or is it misinfo? I know a lot of ppl here play/follow games that originated from China so I was wondering if you guys can share any insight on if this is true or not?

reddit_1koqxio,How much story do you skip in gacha games-and what keeps you playing?,"Got a few questions for those of you who play gacha games regularly:

* **How often do you hit “Skip”?** ‑ Do you auto‑skip everything, or only when the dialogue starts dragging?
* **What makes you** ***not*** **skip?** ‑ Voice acting? Interesting lore? Cool visuals or boss intros?
* **How much of the story do you skip, roughly?** ‑ Main story vs. side quests vs. limited‑time event stories?
* **Can you give % estimates per game?** ‑ For example: 30 % skipped in Genshin, 90 % in Wuthering Waves, etc.
* **Which aspects of gacha games matter most to you?** ‑ If you had to break it down, what share of your enjoyment comes from characters/pulls, gameplay, setting, story, or something else? (e.g., 70 % characters, 20 % gameplay/setting, 10 % story).

As for me—I’m new to gacha games, and I’ve been finding most of their story content kind of boring, especially compared to story‑rich single‑player titles. I dropped **Genshin** around the 2nd–3rd region because it just didn’t hold my attention, and I bounced off **Wuthering Waves** right at the start for the same reason. Only **Zenless Zone Zero** has kept me semi‑engaged—I’d say I skipped about 20–30 % there, which is a big improvement.

Same thing happens with most MMOs, too. I rarely connect with their stories—*except* for **Warframe**, which I genuinely love. I’m thinking of giving **Destiny 2** a shot next to see if it clicks.

I’m not asking all this just to reinforce my own take—I genuinely want to hear other perspectives so I can try seeing these games from another angle. If a lot of people enjoy the story (or other elements), maybe there’s something I’ve been missing, and I’d like to catch that vibe too.

Maybe this info about me will help you answer better:

reddit_search_1iwewqx,My thoughts on Wuthering Waves,"Let's go point by point, things I believe are good AND bad. I'm not going to use ""It's gacha game"" as an excuse for anything.

**Story:**

\+ the concept of Lament is interesting and It's a good hook for the story.

\+ the social ranks adds more authenticity into the cities since we can see more about what is happening behind the curtain of first impression.

\- Rover's memory lost - very lazy way to start plot. We don't even know why she wants to regain her memories. Feeling of purpose? Need to help the world? Meet someone? Achive something? We just know she wants to regain her memories just because. The concept of ""you're connected to this world"" is not explored at all, leaving us with nothing to root for her as main character.

\- Scar as antaghonist. Don't get me wrong, he's a great character, lots of personallity, interesting way to guide the story BUT he appeared in 1.0 and last seen or mentioned in 1.1. The game seem to completely forgot about him leading to inconsistensy in plot. Intead of exploring Fractsidus we just get more and more organizations so the one that was introuced to us in 1.0 as big and dangerous is now completely meaningless.

\- Every ""big story quest"" is completely separated from the rest, the only thing that connects them is Rover and Lament. Feels like unfinished, different stories that just happen is the same world. The order you do those quests does not matter at all. The only thing that connects Black Shores and Rinascita is that one letter/invite we got from Shorekeeper. No foreshadowing for next location, no lesson that we learnt that will be useful in the next destination. Plot just forgets about them as soon as we go further.

\- The main plot just doesn't exist in this world. It's seems like they tried to do Genshin's acts that are separated stories but forgot that they're connected by plot and push us forward in main story. The only hook at this point is Lament, the only reason for us to keep going is to regain memories. In Genshin the more you experience, the more goals you have. It started as ""find our sibling"" and later we're involved in crazy things with many goals. Every destination adds something to our purpose. When in WuWa It's still just ""regain memories"" everything else is temporary an lost as soon as we leave to another location.

\- A lot of dropped things that are ""Big"" not explored by plot at all. No foreshadowing for them to be brought back later.

\- No foreshadowing in general. Because there is no main story as a whole and everything that happens is separated, the foreshadowing last for at best, 1, maybe 2 quests.  Everything is resolved as soon as we get some info drop about it, leaves us with no space for theories, anticipation and feeling of something bigger in the corner.

**Character's design (the personality part):**

\+ there is some diversity

\+ Most of the characters play part in main story for their region

\+ Interesting male characters

\- Character's have little to no personality (mostly accur to women). Seems like main trait for all of them is ""being attractive"" and simp for Rover. The role they play in main plot is important but does not have any emotional impact. Some could be replaced by a mascot and It would require very little rewritting. That also make them predictable and does not allow player getting attached to them for longer that one patch. Because of that there is nothing more to say. Judging character's personality when there's no diversity is meaningless.

**Character's desing (visual aspects judged by main principles for character design, not just how It looks):**

\+ They look stunning visually

\+ the amount of details and work putted in rendering is impressive

\- Not depth. The designs seems to fit them at first but the deeper you go in the plot the more you see how shallow they are. No detailes connected to their past, no symbolism, no foreshadowing.

\- Because for all character's the main color is white or black with one color as an accent, there is no space to use colors to match the personality of the character. Even that one color sometimes does not fit in terms of color language in character design.

\- Very weird physics when It comes to breasts. Even when character is standing still they're jiggly like some jelly. The gravity is generally bit off in this game.

\- Using one main trait as entire inspiration for character. Carlotta is from mafia? Lets make her like stereotypical, anime mafia girl. Cantarella - jelly fish. Jinshi - dragon. Brant - pirate and circus (this is one of the most interesting designs since he got two main traits), Shorekeeper - butterflies. This does not tell character's story or their past/connections. This gives us only one main thing about them.

\- Contrast. The characters either blend with everything having the same value or there's too much contrast: basically very heavy dark element and everything else is just bright. It's very visible when you look at them with no saturation - the most basic way to check If your character's design is good. There should be different values for everything, especially for elements you want to stand out that complements a whole image.

\- Terrible sexualization of female characters. I don't have anything against characters to be sexy with exposed skin, flirty sttitude but you can do both: sexy and classy, still very elegant and charming. It just look like Kuro took path od least resistance to get players attention by focusing on fanservice. Just like some low quality, low efford gachas.

I understand It's Gacha and this genry is based on goonerbait BUT It's not an excuse for bad design in game that is prased for their designs. If someone is creating character for goonerbaiting pupose only, without a single care about plot, personality etc. then It's no longer ""Game first, gacha second""  it's pure ""Gacha mostly, game just by the way""

**Voice acting:**

\+ playing with accents is fun (that point is also in \[-\] section)

\+ male character's voiced very well, fit their personallity 100%

\- All female adult character's sound exaclty the same: sleepy, unbothered, ""attractive"" (almost in seductive way) Even in emotional moments, when they bring sad things to them, are angry, clenching hand in fist, there is no emotions in their voice. I'm not blaming VAs I'm blaming voice director. Their voices also sometimes completely don't match the character's visual presentation which lead to breaking immersion. Not diversity in the way they're portrayed by their voice makes me feel that they're all have the same personality: calm, calculated, flirty.

\- Bacause of the amount of ""calm and sleepy"" voices It's hard to go through entire quest in one go (I got tired after 15 min and had to go for some combat to woke up a bit)

\- Accents are... weird. Kuro said that they won't be forcing British VAs to do american accent but they still do force them to do any other accent. That leads to many mispronunciations that could be forgiven in normal circumstances, yet hard to ignore since characters sounds like they should be able to pronounce them correctly. The accents are also problematic since sometimes they disappear or accure to everything but the words that should be native to the character. Not to mention that some accents were suppose to sound like x accent but since VAs are not natives - the accent is who knows what.

**Storytelling:**

This point would need a whole different post since It's very deep topic with a lot of things to discuss. I'll keep It simple: I can's say anything good about WuWa's storytellling. It's just bad, in some parts more or less. The best proof for my statement is the pure joy of WuWa's players for ability to skip entire main quest. In games with good or at least mid storytelling players would not be happy for that option rather than joy they would express their concerns about ruining immersion, leading to misunderstanding the plot and lowering the emotional impact of It. Even It's good points have big \[-\] to them.

**Enviroment design:**

\+ looks stunning

\+ some places are breathtaking

\+ very detailed

\+ NPC's animations in cities

\- Inconsistent. Sometimes when you see a location from distance you just see some colors and ruins but when you got closed (like, really close) you can see that sky is completely different on this part of the map, yet you saw nothing like that from far away. Flying object, giant hole that appears only If you enter the location. It gives feeling like in old games when different locations were in fact just different layer of the map. (Like you're not in open world but going from one domain to another)

\- Very... empty. A lot of open spaces with nothing to do, some villages without a single NPC or hidden story. Like the only things you can actually explore are those few locations. Thank goodness they added flying mode in Rinascita, running through so much unexplorable terrain would be just painful.

\- Looks like they focused efford only on important locations just filling the gaps between them with emptyness.

\- The amount of those empty spaces is huge. Travelling from one point to another without fast movement can take forever since the teleports are so far away.

\- Incontistancy when It comes to sizes. You see a building quite big from the outside. You go inside and suddenly It's twice as big when It comes to the height and length. I tried to check If It's just my perception but no. Running around the building can take even 10 seconds less than when you run from entry to exit inside (take in account that running around is not straight line, so It should take even more time than run inside the building)

**Exploration:**

\+ QoL mechanics for fast travel

\+ Beautiful views

\+ Special enemies/mini bosses

\- Another thing that just don't exist as a whole...

\- No hidden story, notes, infoes within eviroment

\- ""Secret locations"" are marked on map, why they can't allow us to discover them by ourselves? What ""secret"" It is If simply marked on map?

\- No intriguing layers on map, like cave systems, forgotten ruins hidden deep under the surface, everytime I've entered some ""Secret Location"" It was just small cave with exit right in front my eyes with few enemies inside. Giving you hope of something bigger only to discover that there is nothing.

\- No random quest chains related to main plot

\- Giant locations with nothing to offer beside beautiful view.

No wonder players are grateful for fast travel as the exploration is just boring, shallow, meaningless, based on farming materials, without any connection to main plot, packed with giant empty spaces with just few chests at best.

**Combat:**

\+ very interesting idea of outro and intro that provides buffs

\+ well done dodge/parry system

\+ skill based

\+ different enemies attack patterns

\+ generally well done

\- reflex based, you can't make up for It's lack

\- slow mo that interrupts rythm

\- dodge/parry very basic, no factors that would affect It. In Dark Souls there's multiple ways you can improve your dodge speed, parry by sacrificing another thing like heavy but very protective armor.

\- different attack styles in characters that does not affect your play style since It's still based on dodging and the way you attack does not affect It.

\- elements without much purpose, added completely unnecessary

\- generally not flexible combat, you either have reflects or not, you can't really use healer as main DPS for example. Even with unleashing full potencial of characters - the DMG is not that big which makes fight tiring and long, attack, dodge, switch.

**music:**

\+ very beautiful

\+ different music for different locations

\+ Inspiration from real world

\- Sometimes music does not fit the on screen action. When you fight an enemy you should have someting to encourage you to try harder not to just running around and listen. For some bosses music is way to soft to make you feel the gravity of the fight or too melancholic to stay focused.

\- Music that don't tell any story. It's just there, beautiful but leaving no hints. Music have incredible impact on storytelling, makes you feel what happened in certain location without telling you anything directly or to get the general atmosphere.

\- Wasted potencial for synchronizing music with enemy's movements, giving you hints like when to parry, when to dodge, when to attack, is It your opponet's weak moment or increased resistance for your attacks.

**cutscenes:**

\+ beautiful

\+ quite a lot of them

\- Too chaotic

\- focus mostly on character expression with camera flying around all the time - this make it hard to focus or understand what is actually going on.

\- Too much slow mo, It should be used to put an impact on most important moments not to just exaggerate cool character's movements.

\- Lack of meaning when It comes to the story, cutscenes are another powerful storytelling tool. Creating emotional impact, deliver informations in very visual way. For WuWa the cutscenes are mostly used to show cool fights, to explore only current in game moment not to give you more infos or understanding of the situation.

symbolism:

\+ nice references to Italy in Rinascita.

\- actual meaning of some symbols is very twisted. For example masks in Venecia are used as symbol of lack of social norms or ranks, where evryone are equal - in Rinascita you have very important and visible social structure. To show loosing identity, being completely anonymous, society as collective instead of individuals. Rinascita is focused on individuals, everyone have their identity and role established. The carnival masks also symbolise chaos, lack of rules without any balance. Rinascita already have strict rules and they try to achive balance, nothing is chaoting. Everyting is very calculated - including characters.

\- symbols are very shallow, not used for foreshadowing as It should be.

Lack of support for their own engine game feels laggy and not too responsive which is a huge downgrade for how it’s supposed to be played.

Combat isn’t too much fun to me but that could just be a personal thing im sure there is people who Love the combat. 

Banner rates are atrocious down right horrible and on par with all the other greedy Chinese gacha games released recently.

The game is still very new so they can fix loads of things down the path.

Of the many points that I saw, I put some of the most upvoted and requested items and compiled them in one single post right here for everyone to check and see. 

I have also made sample ideas/visuals based on their feedbacks, to help reinforce the idea on readers. The purpose of this is to have users have an **easier time or reference on what they will put in the Survey Form once it is up in the game.**

Below is the text version of the image cards above so you can easily copy and paste it

\---------------------------------

**EVENTS**

Gilded Nightmarket - The Gilded Nightmarket event is too restrictive with its rewards. Most tokens are locked behind Limited and Anniversary banner convenes, meaning players who don’t pull on these banners can’t access the full set of rewards.In the future, please allow all active players to earn enough tokens through event participation alone in similar events,without requiring banner pulls. This would ensure more players feel rewarded for their engagement, not just their spending.

Cubie Derbie - The Cubie Derby event is fun in design, but its limited time window makes it difficult for many players—especially those with demanding work schedules or living in different time zones—to participate fairly.Strict timing and randomness hurt the experience, making it feel unfair and discouraging, especially for those who are otherwise willing to support the game.

Dreaming Deep Feedbacks

Decrease walking animation time of Rover avatar. Remove confirmation (Proceed) option whenever walking to an empty tile.Regardless of cell distance, the completion time of the avatar to go from one point to another should be the same and within a fraction of a second only.  

There are multiple ways of presenting the story - whether in a visual novel format, comic style format, or an image with voice cutscene. All of this is a big improvement to the current style of presenting the story in this event.

Consider bringing back some of the most-liked features of the old Illusive Realm in its next iteration. The Echo Set feature and its upgrade system, and a more generalized set of Metaphors.

Please display level indicators directly on combat nodes for better clarity.

  
**INTERFACE AND GAMEPLAY**

Battlepass Prompt

The battlepass purchase prompt that appears when collecting rewards is disruptive and pushy. It feels like aggressive marketing and negatively impacts the user experience.Either remove or tone down the prompt, or allow players to explore the paid rewards at their own pace.Constant pop-ups don’t encourage purchases—they push players away and reflect poorly on the game’s image.

Claim All button in events 

Both Thousand Gateways and Dreaming Deep doesn’t have a Claim All button for players to redeem all the unlocked rewards in one instance and instead we are forced to click the rewards one by one.Please add a claim all button or have all the rewards be automatically claimed once the player clicked on any available claim button in game. This will save us time and improve the overall experience participating in these events.

Team Setup UI

As the number of playable characters and team combination increases, please increase the number of team preset available.Background may change based on your last saved location, ability to rename team presets, and a toggeable key (Alt or Ctrl) to display additional details such as weapons and echo loadout.

Echo Spawn Option

As the number of playable characters and team combination increases, please increase the number of team preset available.Background may change based on your last saved location, ability to rename team presets, and a toggeable key (Alt or Ctrl) to display additional details such as weapons and echo loadout.

Training Area

Add a training room with a damage-tracking dummy to help players test builds easily. Current methods (like using holograms or towers) require recording and manual analysis, which is time-consuming.Suggested Features: dummy shows damage stats in a pop-up menu, includes timer, weapon/echo info, and base stats (buffs toggleable); Option to add multiple dummies, clear critical hit indicators, and Improve visual/audio feedback.

  
**CHARACTER**

Audio Settings for Ciaconna Ult

Add an option in the audio settings to independently mute or reduce the volume of Ciaccona’s vocals during gameplay. This would allow players who prefer to enjoy the original soundtrack and in-game sounds to do so without interruption, while still preserving the experience for those who enjoy her performance.

Character Model

Some of the character designs in their outfit is in 2D rather than in 3D 

**GATCHA SYSTEM**

Include a system that increases the chance of obtaining the promotional 5-star characteron the Convene page when the player is on a losing streak of 50/50 pulls. This essentially prevents players from consistently losing their 50/50s by increasing the odds of winning the banner character after a series of losses.

reddit_search_1k6n8nu,Kuro's Idea to have UK only VAs for Wuthering Waves was The Best Idea Ever.,"I just realised that Kuro's idea to have a UK-based VA cast over hiring US-based VAs was a great idea on their part since this prevented Wuthering Waves from suffering 90% of the drama miHoYo is facing right now. Big props to whoever gave Kuro that idea. They should also have a raise.


Edit 1: Apparently I should have made this clear. I am not making this post to say that all US-based VAs are bad. It’s just that I noticed that Kuro’s decision to have a UK-based cast through the UK branch of SIDE studio as a cheaper option resulted in Wuthering Waves being lucky not to get caught up with the VA hostility on set due to the UK VAs acting a lot more professional when interacting with WuWa related content on social media. Plus I am aware that some US VAs like Amber Lee Conners, Zach Aguilar, Alejandro Saab, Ratana and Nathan Nokes do behave professionally on social media by choosing to stay out of it (or in Nokes’s case, welcome Jacob with open arms). As a Singaporean who doesn’t mind any form of EN dub regardless of whether the VAs are from the US or the UK, I apologise to any Americans that felt offended by this post. It was not my intention to sound like a racist prick favouring UK over US. Again, I am really sorry.

Edit 2: Had to make a quick edit after having a realisation I should have said UK-based, not UK-only since some of the VAs in Wuthering Waves are Americian but are based in the UK.

reddit_search_1d1emfi,"A response to WutheringWaves ""identity issue"" and where I think the game will succeed.","I have been browsing around the gachagaming subreddit, to see what other people think, and one of the common criticisms I see, is that the game is too similar to genshin, and has no unique identity.

One of the comments that stuck out to me, was the idea that ""Combat alone wouldn't be able to carry the game"".

I have not reached endgame yet, but that's because I've been having so much fun figuring out the depth of the game's systems.

One of the biggest criticism I have of open world action games, is that they often forget about the **action part of the game**. This has been a problem for me with Genshin since day1.

Genshins combat system is one of the best ive seen in all of gaming. The fluidity of the combat is honestly underrated. The finesse of the input, and dodging capabilities' are really in smooth and in-depth. It even shows with open world exploration.  **The issue however, is that most of it is made redundant.**

Enemies rarely require you to use any skill, and most challenges in the game are Knowledge checks + stat checks, rather than skill checks.

This is fine for casual players, but for those who love playing more sweaty, it becomes a downgrade, when 90% of the games mechanics are not rewarded for executing properly.

Even in exploration, climbing and gliding are not skills you have to improve on, they just become chores to access rewards. Most challenges are flying from point A to point B. or Climbing a mountain while holding the foward button.

&#x200B;

**So imagine my surprise, when wuthering waves not only rewards you for being able to preform some of there combat tricks, they even challenge you on it.**

&#x200B;

[ I wanted to showcase badruns to better highlight my point. It doesnt matter how you do it, long as you have the skills to do it](https://reddit.com/link/1d1emfi/video/sq99klm2uu2d1/player)

This isn't a revolutionary thing. But such a simple mechanic, like doing a backflip, becomes a puzzle you have to complete..

&#x200B;

Most of the action rpg games like genshin, have static mechanics, that once you learn it, the only way they challenge you is by taking them away, or ignoring them completely. And if you want to have unique combat mechanic's, you are forced to roll for a new character , instead of the enemies themselves having it built in.

A good example of this are ruin guards from genhin impact

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rlnnrja7uu2d1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=50a9ff41708c4d635aa7f48b4bf9f8bfc67c859b

In the beginning of genshin, this was a challenging boss, that required you to hit its weak-points in order to beat it. But eventually players go so strong, that hitting the weak points was a waste of time, compared to just doing basic attacks + skills.

later on, they created another variation of this monster that fly in the air instead.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tgd7vkdbuu2d1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9b579ea4e1a0ca478c8c3d54d73ebaba95fc535

But the problem still remained. Long as you had enough dps from any slightly ranged character, you could just hit it hard and kill it without ever interacting with its unique mechanics.

&#x200B;

[Genshin Combat Personified.](https://reddit.com/link/1d1emfi/video/fxjmxz7wuu2d1/player)

Thus turning every mob in the game into a knowledge check, stat check, or even character check. Skill wasn't required as long as you had strong enough units.

\--------------

I think wuthering waves can go in the opposite direction. And allow more combat / parkour mechanics to become a core part of there gameplay loop.

Its no surprise that the appeal of the game lays in how in-depth the combat is. but it still shocks me how much there is to learn. ( seriously I had no idea you could manually do backflips like that ).

And they should / need to lean heavyly into this.

Yes there will always be powercreep and strong units that nullify mechanics in the game. But I don't think that means that all future content should revolve around stat checks. 

* I would love to fight a boss that has a gimmick that throws you into a platformer, and enables you to parkour of its skills to avoid touching the electrified ground or something.
* I want to see more city puzzles, where you are forced to use your brain + skils to get from point a to point B without the hand holding
* I want to see more mechanics, that focus on parrying and dodging rather than just a straight dps checks. I think jianxin is one of the best units for real, just due to her parry mechanic. Being able to block an extra hit outside of parry windows is insane.

&#x200B;

**Wuthering waves identity is already unique from other gacha games, in that it truly embraces the action side of the RPG genre**. **They don't need to establish anything else. Just perfect what they already started.** 

There are so many new mechanics in WW that are popping up, its insane.

* [Triple plunge tech](https://new.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1d17y9n/triple_plunge_tech/)
* [Double Super Jump Tech](https://new.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1d170a1/double_super_jump_with_echo/)

 And while people might dismiss them as gimmicks, I am honestly having a blast running around, and just doing silly combos in the middle of the street, and practicing parkour tricks.

I say the combat system in this game is enough to carry it to success. Cause after playing genshin impact since launch, and form what I've seen so far, they haven't even scratched the surface of what they are capable of.

reddit_search_1hsosat,Message from Solon (CEO of Kurogames) About Wuthering Waves 2.0 Launch:,"Dear everyone,  

Yesterday, Wuthering Waves 2.0, which the team has been preparing for a long time, finally met with players. Here, I and the operations team would like to share with you the performance of the new version yesterday.  

First of all, the new version exceeded player expectations. After its launch, we heard many positive voices from the community and survey feedback. Players can feel that 2.0 has made significant progress compared to previous versions, both in terms of content quantity and quality.  

In terms of operating data, I am very happy to tell everyone that ""Wuthering Waves"" achieved a new high in single-day revenue for the new version yesterday, which is a new milestone. Of course, in addition to reputation and revenue, it is equally important that we see players have more confidence in the long-term operation of Wuthering Waves, believing that the project team has the determination and ability to continue to provide them with high-quality content that exceeds expectations in the future. This is a great encouragement for the team.  

Previously, we always said that the achievements we can reap at each stage must be relatively matched and fair to our current capabilities. One point of effort for one point of harvest, as long as we maintain a pragmatic and progressive attitude and continue to persevere, we will surely be able to continue to create more surprises for users.  

Finally, I am very happy to be able to make a ""game with growth"" together with everyone!  

Solon

reddit_search_1jusu6m,"Wuwa game rating changed from 12+ to 16+ on Google Play, Playstation and other stores","Before anyone says anything, I talked with the mods and they said an okay to this post if there is official source, I think the stores themselves are.

To the question what changed, the answer is nothing, but I think bringing attention to this game rating change is important. It was already 16+ in CN with their own rating system, so them bringing it up to par on global too, more so on Playstation means they might want to depict more than what fits a 12+ rating, since Sony is very trigger happy with censorship rules, more so on anime games. While this is an assumption, reality is that most developers avoid raising the age ratings of a game unless necessary, because it can mean a loss of revenue, a loss of reach.

So again, right now it means nothing, but they did change the ratings which should be noted as it can mean changes for the game, whatever that turns out.



Sources in comments, so I can add image reference to those who can't access site or certain regions.

Note: This change was applied to mostly PEGI ratings, likely to get that extra oompf from ""violence"" to ""violence and nudity"". ESRB works very differently and there is no 12+ rating, they have Teen which is 13+ and the next step is Mature 17+ which is not needed for the game in their rules what can be depicted, as the game will never have ""intense and/or realistic depictions of violence, blood and gore"" because China itself has a strong grip on the depiction of blood already.",1438,354,1744158101.0,WutheringWavesLeaks,Ofanaht,0.97,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWavesLeaks/comments/1jusu6m/wuwa_game_rating_changed_from_12_to_16_on_google/
reddit_search_1diz2yn,The new Wuwa patch notes are fantastic and personally make me very hopeful for the future of the game,"After going through the patches notes the devs have listened to a lot of the complaints from players and I believe they have responded very well or at least up to standard. 

  
**1. Tuner synthesis** - Many players have been complaining about the blue and purple tuners being waste and some players(not me personally) have been complaining about lack of gold tuners. Adding the ability to synthesise blue and purple tuners was an easy request to listen to but I am happy that they are listening to the community. Also in the picture we can see that there is a echo exp synthesis on the side as well, I believe this is a fantastic response to lack of echo exp, although it will be most likely be limited and not provide a large amount of echo exp, timegating echo exp as a resource is a smart move that fits the business models of gacha games and also encourages players to play more via farming more ores to unlock more echo exp. Even if it isn't a huge amount it is a good response to adding more echo exp into the game. 

**2. Guidebook removal of 1 costs** - Reduces the grind for more casual players who don't have time to grind 3 cost echoes, a great change imo as the 3 cost as we know are the hardest to grind the right main stats. Not much else to add here just a great small change.

**3. Data bank level 21**- Well I don't have to say much about this one, 100% 5 star rates is just a fantastic addition and will remove a lot of the echo grind that just seems pointless. Pre UL 40 the 50% rate honestly seemed reasonable to me but once hitting UL 40 and the databank stopping at 80% just increased the echo grind in a way that was not smart to increase. I don't think increasing the grind for a gacha game is a terrible idea as that is aligning with the ideals to eventually profit but creating a 20% chance for a purple echo would just take players time and not really create any way to profit of it unless they introduced a p2w way of providing 100% chance of gold echo drops. Perhaps introducing it as the battlepass exclusive benefit couldve been a way to profit of of it but I think that would lead to more backlash then the potential profits. That saying I think 100% chance of gold echoes as a battlepass exclusive isn't even a terrible idea as most players at UL 40 aren't really complaining about the 80% drop rate, at least me personally I got no issues with it but 100% is welcomed.

  
**4. Other echo changes** - Tacet field animation removal is another great change not much else to say about that, we asked for it and they gave it to us in the very next patch. It is basically the treatment that should be expected but them following up on it is great. Lowered shell credit costs is another great change, lots of people in the later stage of the game are lacking in shell credits to upgrade their characters, weapons, skills, etc. Echoes was one of the upgrades that didn't guarantee benefits as if they rolled bad then many players are incentivised to ditch that echo and start upgrading a new one which essentially voids all the shell credits spent on that echo whereas an upgrade to a character level or skill is a permanent upgrade. 

  
**5. Simplified cruisewing** - Personally on my phone (iphone 12) i had no issues with it but my gf did have many issues with it on her phone and it is just another great small change which albeit a small change is a meaningful one as it displays a quick uptake and response on player feedback and complaints. 

  
**6. Coral shop increase from 6 to 7 pulls per currency** - This is a change that nobody and I mean nobody is going to complain about but one I personally believe is not needed and a greedy demand from most people asking for it. First I'll clarify why I said most instead of all, we get 18 pulls every 42 days from the coral shop where compared to genshins 10 per 30 will lead to more pulls overall. However, 6 of these pulls are weapon banner pulls and genshins model will lead to more characters in the long run which are a higher source of entertainment or value for the average player. For players that genuinly wanted more characters from these 18 pulls every 42 days via the coral shop, I believe they are justified to ask for this change. However, I believe the demand for changing the model from 42 days to 30 stems from mainly greed and misunderstanding that the 42 day model will lead to more pulls overall. This is why I saw most people asking stems from greed, that saying I could be completely wrong and most people could actually just want more characters, I will acknowledge that my justification for this mostly stemming from greed may just be a bad observation by me but it is what I believe. That saying many people asked for an increase in pulls and they responded so once again it shows kuro quickly responded to player feedback and making a change which is fantastic. 

  
**7. Echo exp** - kuro have adopted a model of providing more echo exp through events, which I think is a good way to timegate resources and encourage more playtime from players. That saying echo exp is one of the things that my account is suffering from and I would assume most players are. Echo exp through events and synthesis both contribute to the model of encourage more play, get more rewards which in the long run I believe will be a good response. Honestly I haven't finalised my thoughts on echo exp as eventually we will all be able to level our echoes and characters. But assuming players will play till then is not a correct idea and responding to complaints now will lead to that. Some ideas I have seen from other people are reducing cost of tacet fields to 40, creating a seperate domain for echo exp at a lower cost or at higher drop rates, increasing tacet field echo exp drops, halfing the cost of waveplates for a certain number of tacet fields per week. These are all ideas which I believe are fantastic to adress the issue however a brainless idea going around right now is allowing echoes to convert to echo exp. At face value this seems like the most simple idea but please please just consider how against the business model of a gacha that would be and imo would be a game destroying idea if incorrectly implemented.

reddit_search_1gvzcdm,People who say Wuwa has no worldbuilding or lore is being disrespectful towards how much the game can offer.,"Title.

Many says the story sucks, I can agree to disagree, not every story has to be for everyone. On the other hand, I seen just as many people say Wuwa has no worldbuilding... and that's something I don't take lightly with how much the game offers in science, concepts and... quantum physics, I guess.

First, I guide everyone towards my [timeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1gvokn1/wuthering_waves_timeline_version_10_edition/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1) (work in progress) and say there is no worldbuilding after seeing how many things were said retroactively.

Second, science time.

The waveworn phenomena, which the whole lament builds upon is a real quantum physics stuff. All matter amd energy are waves and in their most simple forms and a sum of those determine their specific positions in time. In short, Wuwa takes this scientific concept of „everything is built up by waves” and bends it to it absolute limits. Waves are a smaller particle than atoms and cannot be broken down any further. People become resonators because they attune to these waves or even gain a sixth sense like how Yapyap is a wind whisperer pretty much. I think someone who enjoys scifi can find many interesting concepts in the lore of Wuwa.

Some who don’t read character profiles might even think that everyone has supernatural powers and it’s more magical, but the rule of „magic is just science you don’t understand yet” stand correct here. Well, how does Jinhsi pulls out a whole dragon from her butt if it’s not magic?! The answer is right on her profile, Jinhsi manipulates particles and reflects light in the form of a holographic looking dragon in the image of Jué. Pretty much everyone has a how did they got their power and how might it work on their profile, except when not for in-universe reasons that all of these are evaluation reports taken at some point about them.

How did Encore’s power become a thing? Due to stress, her toys started talking to her on her mothers funeral, in a way, Cosmos and Cloudy is a kind of discord, just like what Baizhi has. Baizhi got hers when her whole expedition team died in a Sonoro Sphere.

How did Danjin got her powers? Due to heavy emotional stress again, when her whole family got murdered.

Calcharo got it because he was under critical environmental conditions.

Aalto got born with it. 

Those earrings look cute on Verina! Well, except, they aren’t earrings, they grow on her, just like how vines grow out of her spine.

Chixia’s red hair is cool. Except it wasn’t red originally, the awakening of her power made it so it’s red now.

All these and more are literally there in front of every player, yet some just don’t care and trash the worldbuilding and lore as if it’s nonexistent.

Yangyang, Mortefi, Yuanwu all got different mutations due to their powers or slight overclock in Yangyang’s case, that’y where the feather hair and dragon scales comes in.

But even outside the ingame lore, seen a lot complain about no social media content early on, yet apparently no one reads the wuthering geography posts, detailing key locations, sometimes explaining terms, events or anything related to the new patch. Put your hands up, how many of you even opened the game archives to see the explanations about Black Shores and other things added in 1.3? These are not even everything the game worldbuilding and lore offers.

Again, I can understand the Master Love and story not being your cup of tea. But if even after these examples you say there is no worldbuilding or lore in the game, I will hire Calcharo for a coin to hunt you down personally. Eyes are there to see with them when open.

reddit_search_1i5xs2x,What features do you WANT Wuwa to copy from other games?,"For me it's:

* Hoyo's party character lineup with custom entrance animations and voice lines. I think it adds more oomf and quality to the gameplay loop. I used to move my Genshin characters just to see their animations. It gives every character another chance to stand out.
* Genshin's option for daily quest locations. It'd be nice to not have to jump between Jinzhou and Ragunna for the daily quests. It'd also make it more likely to get the wanted quests for achievements. This will only get more tedious as they'll add more areas.
* A texting system similar to Warframe or HSR. It would make sense with our gourds and would allow more characterisation and separated romance. It would be nice to have cannon group chat's for the Midnight Rangers or the Black Shores and Fool's Troupe etc.
* Arknights: Endfield's UI is a great example of what Wuwa could do. It's incredibly stylish yet functional and clean UI that obliterates what we have. The different angles and pops of colour add so much to to it. Of course they should implement it in their own darker, wavy, star shapey way but it's great. Persona is another example of incredible UI design but I don't think it'd fit a gacha game as much, want to be proven wrong though!

reddit_search_1kmz6lk,Wuwa on Comicup and backlash from femcels against Kuro Games,"Kuro purchased the physical ticket-face advertisement for China's largest comic convention, Comicup, which attracts over 300,000 attendees but received negative reviews in comments from certain audiences in comments across all promotional platforms.

Many claims Wuwa has no real art scene in China (which just means there are hardly any ""male on male"" or ""woman on woman"" fanart going around) and majority of the content just being AI generated or porn. Others say Kuro has fewer street presence at this convention than niche anime film doujin circles, which really has no relation to who sponsors an event for advertisement or not.

According to a female chinese player, Wuwa has near-zero female attendees at China's offline events—the most extreme gender gap globally.

I request everyone to stay civil in the comments.

reddit_search_1k9ecpa,PSA: Zani shows the increasing greed of Kuro Games - 2.3 Pre-Release Analysis (by Selkey without leaks),"**Important Edit: It seems that a lot of people have made the assumption that I'm implying that ""Zani NEEDS Phoebe"" or ""Zani is unplayable without Phoebe"".**  
**Both of these statements are wrong and I never said something along those lines. She just loses a lot of damage and her rotations are harder without Phoebe, that's all.**   
**Please don't spread the misinformation, that she ""needs"" Phoebe to be functional. If the losses in performance I illustrated do not matter to you, then she is completely fine with Spectro Rover and will probably clear endgame just fine (like everyone else).** 

Hello, my name is [Selkey](https://www.youtube.com/@SelkeyYT) and I make high level guides, quickswap showcases and general WuWa content.

**Disclaimer: If you wish to pull for Zani, I am not stopping you. I only wish to show how her kit design impacts her gameplay and damage.**

# Video Version:

[Zani - A Masterclass in Greed - 2.3 Pre-Release Analysis (5:34)](https://youtu.be/T1iezKCwjIA)

I recommend watching the video version for some additional information or if you prefer listening over reading.

# The Problem with Zani:

As you may know, Zani's kit was revealed recently and it made a case for a prediction I've made several months ago for the game.

Zani looks like an extremely strong character and with all the stars aligned, she will likely do phenomenal amounts of damage, due to the insane multipliers on Phoebe. **But there is one BIG problem.**

To make it short, Zani's highest damage output at S0R1 is locked behind another limited character existing within her team, that isn't Shorekeeper.

***Not only that, but we now have a clear case for Kuro being willing to lock Zani's damage, behind a completely different characters signature weapon as well. In this case, Phoebe's signature.***

[credit to u\/sliferx for creating this absolute banger](https://preview.redd.it/ephaul20pfxe1.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf521ded9e07669d700f71e1e74c720812792ae4)

**This is horrible news for anyone that is F2P or a low spender**, because the power disparity keeps getting larger in terms of signature and character reliance. Fulfilling the conditions for maximum damage is becoming so expensive, that you may wonder:

***Why would a company, that previously released fully functional and self-sufficient characters, go down this path of making characters, that neither function fully without specific teammates, nor will they even reach their full damage at their own S0R1.***

Unfortunately, I cannot explain this change in character design direction with anything else than ""greed"" and today I wish to provide the reasons for why I believe this to be the case.

# The continuous design change of WuWa DPS characters:

Lets quickly go over the history on this. A lot of people assumed Jinhsi to rely on Yinlin when she came out, but that was simply untrue and she has many great alternatives.

Then we had Carlotta, who relied on Zhezhi to reach her max potential and that was the first case of a character whose BiS was a limited character and there were no ""good"" 4 star options. At the very least, for me, I solved the Carlotta issue by quickswapping, so you could at least work around it with practice and player skill. But I do know a lot of people, who felt **pressured** into pulling a character they didn't want, just for Carlotta.

After Phoebe's release, we had our very first character, whose functionality was very questionable as a standalone character. She very much relies on Spectro Rover to function as a viable character, but at least Spectro Rover was free and had a very good F2P weapon option.

Now, with Zani, we have our first character, that is severely handicapped without their BiS partner and their signature, on top of needing her own. Just like Phoebe, she does not function as a standalone DPS, without a Spectro Frazzle applier, but on top of that, if you do not use Phoebe with her, **you are losing out on up to 130% Spectro Frazzle DMG amplification. An absolutely gigantic DPS loss, that cannot be worked around as Zani's damage is typed ""Spectro Frazzle DMG"".**

# Let me repeat this, you lose 130% DMG Amplification without Phoebe.

[30&#37; Amp \(Zani's DMG is typed \\""Spectro Frazzle DMG\\""\)](https://preview.redd.it/c55fzy11tfxe1.png?width=1738&format=png&auto=webp&s=c80e4bf4e2ffe0df61ff496ce12bbc2ea18df224)

[100&#37; Amp \(Zani's DMG is typed \\""Spectro Frazzle DMG\\""\)](https://preview.redd.it/fqoqdox4tfxe1.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fa62784e6b6d16b349f1083a971376bfaabbf89)

Her only alternative as a partner is Spectro Rover, who is lacking in Spectro Frazzle application and amplification, which will cause huge problems for Zani's functionality and damage output.

# So what happens if I don't have Phoebe?

Without overwhelming you with numbers and her wikipedia essay of a kit, here is a short summary of what happens if you don't have Phoebe:

***1. Massive DPS loss for Zani***

***2. Less casual friendly rotations***

***3. You will have less moves in Zani's kit***

Yes, not only do you lose an unprecedented amount of damage, but now, just because you don't own a different character, **Kuro Games is actively taking Zani's damaging moves away from you**, while also making you work way harder to achieve a worse result. You can imagine it like Changli only having one skill instead of two and the only way to get the second one is by owning her best partner, ridiculous.

If that wasn't enough, Zani locks down team flexibility by needing Spectro Frazzle to function, so you are forced to use Spectro Rover, if you don't have Phoebe.

# Conclusion:

This is an extremely worrying trend, that severely impacts my faith and trust in the company. I perceive this monetization approach as greedy.

Kuro is literally splitting up a character's full damage upon multiple characters and weapons and sells the character in a significantly weaker state without their best partner. Quite convenient that they just happen to have a choice banner during the Zani banner for anyone that skipped Phoebe!

[Thank you so much Kuro Games!](https://preview.redd.it/341fwfltofxe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb883b2e2fc8ff222aeb740f8284428957711eff)

# My personal stance:

**I wish to get a character at their full strength after I lost my 50/50, spent 210 pulls to hit pity and get S0R1.**

The mere fact that I have to do the same thing again, just to have access to a different characters full damage output, is insane to me, especially if this happens to be a common trend. Spending up to 420 pulls for every new Main DPS to have their full damage is not something I and many others can afford long term, which puts us in a very vulnerable spot for powercreep, HP inflation or simply not being able to play what we want.

**At this moment in time, we have no relevant HP inflation or powercreep to talk of, so it won't be an immediate issue. However, that doesn't mean it can't become an issue in the future.**

# The counter argument:

Some people may make a ""necessity counter argument"", which basically entails: ""We don't need the extra damage."", to which I will say, ""then why are they taking it from us?"".

**The answer is obvious, to sell more characters and weapons, which no one can deny.**

There is also a very suspicious trend going on, where the DPS gain of the first and second sequences have just been getting higher and higher over time.

[18&#37; vs 57&#37; lol](https://preview.redd.it/nwm6cbabtfxe1.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=82dab9524faa1beacf7fdd7c4c7a724fc518f58a)

[I understand that this may not be the best example, in this case, look up Brant lmao](https://preview.redd.it/rdmenjnbtfxe1.png?width=1693&format=png&auto=webp&s=fee372ea039f72cb953612812e80d77ffaa49139)

**But yes, in the current state of the game, you do not ""need"" Zani's maximized damage to clear anything.** But once again, that doesn't mean this will always be the case.

# My recommendation:

For this reason I recommend to tread forward with caution. These design choices are more than alarming and I wish to make people aware of the F2P and low spender unfriendly direction, that the game has taken.

I really hope that we can stop Kuro from going further down this path. I do not feel comfortable with being pressured into pulling everything, just so whatever character I wanna play will do appropriate amounts of damage.

That's all I really wanted to say, enjoy your Zani pulls and have a good one.

reddit_search_1hfyhhj,The cutscene director of WuWa addresses the issue of Rover outfits: they are under consideration but won't be in-game soon,"TL;DR: Rover outfits are being discussed internally but will take longer than expected to implement. 

meng君 used to be an influential PGR CC who creates high quality animations for the game and was later recruited by Kuro to be the cutscene director. He has since moved on to Wuwa and directed most of the cinematics since 1.1. He streams on Bilibili every now and then as a semi-official channel to gather inputs and answer some common questions from players. On yesterday's stream he discussed the commonly requested Rover outfits. 

The main issue is avoiding cloth clipping into character model and interactable objects. The QC process will take much longer because they have to check every cutscene since 1.0. And since MC appears much more frequently in the story, players are much more likely to notice clipping (compared to other characters, e.g. SK has a minor clipping issue in one of the Act 8 cutscenes). This limits the art direction of any future Rover outfit since they rather be safe than making it aesthetically pleasing. 

The other issue is immersion. It's a common problem for games with real-time cutscenes to break immersion when the MC is wearing weird outfits (Link saving Zelda while wearing only underpants). They want every Rover outfit to look appropriate across all cutscenes. 

And lastly, he said Kuro is well aware that the Wuwa community tends to be very critical of the game and even tiny mistakes get scrutinized which usually devolve into doomposting. Because of this they have to take extra time to ensure the quality of content especially when it's related directly to the MC.

In terms of timeline, Rover outfits are still ""under consideration"" and won't be released in the near future. ",621,79,1734396395.0,WutheringWaves,Alternative-Owl-3046,0.97,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1hfyhhj/the_cutscene_director_of_wuwa_addresses_the_issue/

Multiple kuro ""drama"" ccs are still defending the game and calling all(not some, ALL) of the ppl comparing the anniversary with other games the hs word(The mods don't allow me to say it). The new character story quest and the cube racing events are the only genuinely redeeming quality of this whole nothing burger of an update. It feels like a filler patch(it is) and I felt less hyped for this anniversary than even 2.2. I do think kuro will stop fumbling sometime soon and come back with a banger like they did from 1.0 and that we just have to sit through it. Que the kill kuro cycle.

Edit 2: A lot of people seem to be very confused as to why I put cube racing event as ""redeeming"". Truthfully, I was grasping at straws. The reason why I ""liked"" the cube racing event is the only one that makes me feels like we are all a part of an event(which is what an anniversary should be).

Like I said. My only letdown about Wuthering Waves is **the lack of Co-Op contents**. And I think Co-Op is a HUGE part for the success/enjoyment of a game (PERSONALLY, I know this is not true for everyone). 

Back in the day, during the Tower of Fantasy release, I loved changing channel in order to do raid/co-op challenge with 30+ strangers. I know WuWa is not a MMO. But I honestly think just a Co-op Tactical Hologram with friends/strangers would be an amazing incentive for the people to play the game, try and pull new characters, just having fun without the chore pressure.

Also, I'm thinking about the beautiful ""limited dungeon"" we had during some storyquest (like the Jiyan one). I feel making Co-Op dungeons from it is a great thing in order to recycle the limited scenary we saw.

It's hard to say but... Genshin Coop (that's empty af) is still better than WuWa Coop. And I feel Kuro needs to capitalize on what Genshin failed to do, big time.

reddit_search_1k38ult,The WuWa Anniversary controversy is a cautionary lesson to consider various qualities in a game instead of solely focusing on generousity,"This is a tale, a cautionary tale, to stifle your expectations on anniversaries, and be more careful in the future to judge a game or an event based on 'generousity'. If you play a game only because it seemed 'generous' to you, I think it is a red flag and indicative of the state or quality of the game, but also of you yourself, as it means you probably actually *don't* care about the game itself as much as someone actually invested in a game would do.

It sounds very ironic to say, but I actually am starting to appreciate how ""stingy"" Genshin is. I accept to not being able to get all limiteds, that is fine. I just go for those that seem appealing or exciting to me. I will tell you what I have learned over the time. Customers tend to have sticky expectations. They remember it well. Notice how they bring up 1.0 to 1.2 rewards? Yeah. I think it is okay to pin the blame on Kuro in part, because they set themselves up too much. It made people longe for something similar for anniversary... and then it didn't happen. 

And, sure, Genshin has been increasing its rewards occasionally, such as giving more pulls on Lantern Rite, but they don't do it so much. To them, it is a long term decision. It is basic consumer marketing 101. I respect Mihoyo because they learned to not bow down too much to consumers or give too much freebies, which is unfortunately what WuWa and Kuro did.

It also means now hopefully some of you will realize that a game should not solely be comprised of generousity, but also of various elements, such as story, gameplay, QoL, media... Even if they might have 'better QoL than Genshin', I will not come back to WuWa, because I did not like their story and gameplay direction. And I wish more people paid more attention to these aspects, but instead we are perpetuating the whole QoL stuff and making fun of Genshin for 'lack of QoL'. Even HSR is facing a bit of backlash now and then despite having QoL because their core aspects are not satisficatory at times. **QoL does not save a game nor does it matter that much if your core game has serious problems.** I realize Genshin could use a few more QoLs but that one can wait.

It feel bad that I am vindicated, in no way do I want to see games fail but I have been trying to tell a few people of this warning sign. I have been trying to at least inform people of the game's pain points, but their aggressive responses made me stop posting entirely. It's just not possible to reason with them. I wish they were more critical with their own game, but at this rate, if the game falls off, it will be because of the community that seem incapable of reasoning or of accepting criticism.",0,186,1745104074.0,gachagaming,AntonioS3,0.39,https://reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1k38ult/the_wuwa_anniversary_controversy_is_a_cautionary/

Saying things like ""Kuro is just as bad as Hoyoverse"" or ""they’ve destroyed my trust"" over a lack of freebies is just... puzzling. Feedback is good, but *constructive* feedback is better. If the takeaway from the community after a great content streak since release is “all that doesn't matter if not enough free stuff” why would devs feel motivated to keep pushing quality?

""They're improving the game to make more money!"" Yes, they’re a company. But unlike many others, they’re improving the actual product instead of just milking us with powercreep and shady monetization. If the end result of that is the community will destroy you the moment they don't get enough freebies anyways, might as well do the same shit these other companies do. Release new characters more powerful than the last every couple weeks ~~with global passives~~ but throw a free Verina every once in a while and you'll achieve the same community approval apparently, and probably more money.

My friends and I have never been this horribly unlucky in any other gacha we’ve played, never this many back go back 50/50 losses. 

One of my friends won 50/50 ONCE (Jinshi release), losing every 50/50 with 60+ pity since. 

Yes it is luck based, but this is just extremely ridiculous 😭 Two already quit over BAD LUCK, that was a first for them (and they play FGO😭). At this point the 50/50 feels like 10/90…. 

I personally do not play Genshin anymore, but I have heard that they introduced something this game also needs. I believe that after 3 back to back 50/50 losses, the 4th 50/50 loss should trigger a second mechanic that “wins” it instead.

And to all the ppl who keep saying “luck issue”, dw one day you’ll end up on the other end as well😔 (my experience)",2665,623,1746229539.0,WutheringWaves,-yael,0.94,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1kdfdae/wuwa_desperately_needs_something_that_prevents_4/
reddit_search_1k552g6,A (different) perspective from a Day 1 player (long read),"Hey community, I wanted to touch ground with you, especially other veteran 1.x players and see if we align on these sentiments. 

What made the 2.3 anniversary bittersweet for me. 

Background : 
I have been a day one player, I have invested time and money into this game, because I loved and still love it. I did not know Kuro before playing, I did not play PGR, but I knew about it. 

For me, the characters & combat was fun and the company was generous with pulls and even free characters, that made it easier for me to get everything I want and spend responsibly for things I wanted to add to my account. I definitely still had to pay up to get every limited character, their weapon and I even had to skip characters I didn't feel were interesting to me. 

I played other action gacha, from HI3 to many other known ones. Wuwa pulled me in because it excelled at combat. It's story was interesting (but messy), but the world was interesting to me and the game was actually difficult. I loved it. 

So... 
After watching 2.3 anniversary, I have no issues with their content shown, if anything I am excited for permanent rogue like, something that has kept me engaged with wuwa for a long time now.
I am interested in trying out the cube content as well, because it does affect combat. (albeit being silly) 

I think the actual playable content were getting is definitely among the biggest we have gotten for a mid-patch. And I am grateful to kuro for focusing on that. 

Being given free characters without enough content to try them on, will ultimately lead to quick disinterest, I think Kuro made the right choice here. 

However, my trust got hurt a good bit when I saw their best chance to show appreciation for the players that allowed them to even become this successful, was completely absent from that event.

I don't need free characters or weapons, but to see all bonus rewards and catering towards whales or new players only, simply made me feel not appreciated.

I'm not a whale, but still put a few hundred bucks into wuwa over a year. I'd say I've done my part in contributing to kuros success, with money, feedback, my time and engaging with the community. And I'm not alone in this I'm sure, most of you have done this too. 

And now I don't know what to think. If the game does keep catering to new players and whales, then maybe that's the reality of gacha games. 
If that is how it's meant to be, I suppose I will have to look elsewhere to ""feel appreciated"". 

And kuro is definitely facing fierce competition in this regard, and that's why they are trying to maintain market share as best as possible. 


In the end my desire to keep supporting Kuro is a  mentality thing. And that's both on me (receiver) and kuro games (messenger).

I want them to acknowledge that the reason they enjoy such high praise from the community is their generosity and ever improving QoL and that was only possible because it's been a two-way system. Them looking to earn our trust and us giving them our trust (and money and time).

If kuro wants to focus primarily on spenders and new players, whether that is just for 2.3 or for all future endeavors, where does that leave us, long time players? Are we all just gonna move on to the new shiny thing anyway, or stick with kuro because of investment fallacy? 

How can kuro show appreciation for veterans without catering to ""beggars"" who want everything for free? (and are never satisfied no matter) 
What would make you feel rewarded as a day 1 player?

reddit_search_1jd1yf1,PSA: The new WhiWa cycle is unreasonably hard (by Selkey),"Hey guys, Selkey here. No self-promotion this time. **Just upvote this, so people become aware of this.**

This might be the one time where you can genuinely believe that a ""Kuro messed up"" thumbnail will be accurate.

As most of you probably know me, I will keep the self-introduction short. I am a professional quickswap WuWa player since 1.1 and play the game at a very high level.

I've streamed myself for about 3 hours attempting to beat the new WhiWa cycle using crazy strategies like triple healer teams and Liberation spam teams on a very well invested account. Despite my best efforts, I was only able to get an A using the best available strategies at this point in time (which is not using the golden tokens lol).

[You will understand why I'm smiling when you try it yourself.](https://preview.redd.it/1t775yzml5pe1.png?width=1981&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2dcb35d9d620ee35cff6476ed591d432281e3f4)

Anyway, I'm just here to be very clear about the following conclusion:

**The new WhiWa cycle is unreasonably hard and it will likely get hotfixed. Most people will not be able to even reach the lowest rating using normal strategies, unless they have character sequences and/or signatures.**

**Please be patient for the next 2-3 days, we should remain calm, till we are certain, that this is actually intended. If nothing changes within the next week, then I want everyone to collectively speak up against this level of insane powercreep. This makes even HSR MOC look fair and balanced.**

# Please do not send any negativity or harassment towards Kuro over the new WhiWa cycle.

We will see in the next couple days, what Kuro thinks of the reception of the new WhiWa cycle. I want everyone to give very clear feedback, that this WhiWa is way too difficult for most players and has to use ridiculous strategies to be beaten.

That's all I wanted to say, thank you for reading and I hope me out of all people saying this, will make it belivable.

A lot of quality games cost money to play or are free but have advertisements or the full game is locked behind some subscription/membership, but Wuthering Waves is one of the live service games that won't stay live if it doesn't profit.

I understand that gacha games are predatory and make a lot of money, but as long as it is releasing quality content, I don't see why I should stop supporting the game. At the end of the day I can spend on it as much as I want or nothing.

However, if Kuro doesn't earn enough they can't continue development or improve the game. What if they start earning more and we get longer animations and more sound tracks? Wouldn't that be awesome?

Of course, I understand that the way the livestream was presented was insulting to players, but things happen and you have the right to voice your opinion in hopes of Kuro making a change, but lashing out may damage the company too much and you might decide to quit for good or stop supporting Kuro, but before you quit, I would like for you to answer a question.

reddit_search_1ehosro,IMO wuwa’s potential is stunted because people only bring it up to talk bad about other games. Thoughts?,"Kuro didn’t procure an audience that sees wuwa for wuwa, but rather it’s “the game that will make hoyo change their ways”.

It’s an unfortunate reality. The game is not going to be dead by any means but a lot of players never gave it a real chance because the community turned off a lot of people. Usually if you go on /r/wutheringwaves, especially a couple weeks ago, half the discussion were basically crapping on genshin, which is your opinion and that’s fine; but if it’s the only discussion that surrounds the game, it’s not going to make people want to stay. It’s like when someone dates someone else just to spite their ex by making them jealous, but they don’t really actually like the person they’re currently dating and they break up a month later

It’s still going to be a top 5-10 game for now, but it’s not the absolute smashing blockbuster people thought it would be. Next patch’s revenue will absolutely not be higher than changli for example (IYKYK). There’s also a lot of long-term things about the game that have become more apparent with time that are absolutely not “better genshin”, namely how lackluster the events are 

We’ll see though.

reddit_search_1kfruq4,Message From The Mods,"Just some things we wanted to address to the community:

## 1. Clarity On Our Ties To Kuro Games:

Yes, this is the official subreddit for Wuthering Waves. Yes, we have a Kuro Games staff member on the moderation team as well as a means to be in contact with them. That said, they do not participate in the moderation of the subreddit, enforce its rules, or have influence over our actions. 
No, we are not employed by Kuro. No, we do not have special access to test servers, information, etc. of any degree. When news drops regarding the game, we are made aware at the same time as you are. When the community is given rewards, we are part of that same exact community, so a win for the community includes us as well, we are not separate.

## 2. Addressing The Increase Of Harassment Towards The Moderation Team:

This mostly relates to modmails: there seems to be a thought process that because the person being spoken to is a moderator, one can attack them and still expect cordiality in return because anything else is unbecoming and would make for great drama on certain drama oriented subreddits. This moderation team has been called every insult and slur in the dictionary, attacked daily in modmail for simply upholding the rules, and gaslit by users who think they’re being clever by deleting the very comment that earned them a ban in the first place, as if we don’t log it, and then claiming they didn’t do anything wrong. 
I personally had a user, who was only temporarily banned for three days due to a clear violation of the rules, go out of their way to harass me. They spammed modmail, flooded my Reddit DMs, tracked down my Discord account to continue the harassment, and even went so far as to find and harass me on my personal social media. All of this just over a simple 3 temp ban. Despite that, I have believed that we should stay cordial no matter how frustrated we get. However, some individuals have repeatedly and deliberately tried to hurt us, as if there isn’t a human being on the other side of the screen. 
Going forward, we will not engage with harassment. If you attempt to harass or attack anyone on the moderation team when sending in a modmail, you will simply be muted.

## 3. Addressing Brigading:

It has become extremely obvious that there are certain individuals and groups who come here specifically to fan the flames. We especially saw a spike in this during the anniversary issues, even our subreddit analytics reported activity significantly out of the normal range and standard deviation. 
We are aware of these individuals to a high degree of certainty, but have allowed them to remain so long as they were “voicing their concerns,” as we believe everyone has that right. 
We do not allow our community to disparage other users, subreddits, communities, etc., because we believe that by being better individuals, we build a better, more welcoming community. 
However, at this point, if we have a very-high degree of certainty that you are here participating in brigading, we will issue a permanent ban. Consider this your final warning.

## 4. Addressing Leaks:

One of the core aspects we have maintained from the start is providing multiple chances when it comes to leak-related rule violations. Just simply on the basis that everyone deserves a second chance (within reason). However, leaks can cause serious damage, misconstrue community expectations, ruin experiences, and overall spread misinformation.
We will be revisiting this policy with stricter enforcement in mind. EDIT: to clarify this stricter enforcement is in regards with those infractions that are only attainable through participation in leaked content (e.g. someone describes a characters kit when they haven't even been shown in game)

## 5. Addressing Criticism and Repeated Posts:

Anyone who has been active in this subreddit can speak to its history of allowing criticism to be expressed, whether it was the recent anniversary controversy, the Tencent merger controversy, the female-male ratio controversy, the launch issues, etc.

Criticism is and always will be welcome here. However, when criticism overruns the subreddit, moderation becomes necessary. There does not need to be a wall of posts addressing the same issues with slightly different wording.
If a criticism post has nothing substantially new to add and could reasonably be a comment under an existing criticism post, it will be removed and redirected there. 

During the recent anniversary criticism that was taking place, we noticed that users who just wanted to post something completely unrelated to the anniversary, were having their posts mass reported and downvoted by the community because it did not fit with the negativity, and that should not be acceptable.

There also seems to be a misunderstanding that flooding the subreddit with repeated posts will make Kuro notice. In reality, the best way to reach Kuro is through the in-game feedback function. 

While this may be the official subreddit of the game, it is still an extremely minor sub-community of the greater overall WuWa community. Even with this recent anniversary drama, the moderation team put together the community's concerns and forwarded that to Kuro ourselves. 
This is not a drama subreddit, but yes the game will inevitably have drama tied to it, and we will let those issues be discussed and spoken about but within reason.

## 6. Addressing Emotes: 

This has been asked a few times by the community. After a long back and forth with Reddit, it seems that we have a hard limit of 20 personal emotes for the subreddit. As of right now we have hit those 20 emotes, however, in the future we may do a community based voting on which emotes we have for the subreddit.

## 7. Final Remarks:

I’m just going to address some random things I saw in some posts to bring forth clarity

* If you post something that is leak discussion, or based on information only available through leaks, even if it is just an hour before it becomes public, it will still be treated as leak discussion.

* Yes, we should leave a note when locking posts that require moderation intervention or when a moderation discussion is happening. We will work on this going forward.

* If a post consistently requires moderation intervention (i.e., generates a high volume of rule-breaking discussion repeatedly), we will lock it down. This is a practical necessity; we cannot divert all our attention to a single post while neglecting the rest of the subreddit.

* The reason why rules on the sidebar are not explicit is not just to umbrella cover situations but also because Reddit limits the character count and we have to convey the rules within those limits.

* u/WutheringWaves account is not a unique kuro games staff member, but rather an official account with the original intentions of direct communication from Kuro to the subreddit (announcements/events/etc) but as anyone can see it ended up not being used.

On that note, we are volunteers doing this in our free time. We cannot see every post and comment immediately. If you see something breaking the rules, please report it.

A recurring issue we encounter is rule breakers pointing to other unmoderated content as an excuse, but almost always, no reports were ever sent in. The rules apply equally to everyone, and 99% of the time, once something is reported, we moderate it promptly.

We ask for your help: if you see rule-breaking behavior, use the report function rather than using it to justify breaking rules yourself.

reddit_search_1jg523z,(Not ragebait) Genuinely why is Zani so popular?,"Okay I want to start this off by saying that this is my %100 honest opinion. Yours might differ and its completely okay. I am not here to bash on Zani, im just curious to understand everyones opinion on her. 
I love wuwa a lot and love every character they make (even Yuanwu tbh). They all feel like characters with some depth (except some 1.0 characters ig). To maybe give some perspective on what im about to write, I am a gay male (hope I wont get bashed for this.) I love women, not in a sexual way i just love the way they look and mostly always liked female characters a lot more than male characters. From my experience, I dont find any type of “drawing” or “anime” character particularly hot or cant feel anything towards them. Male female does not matter. My scale of how much I like a character is usually their design and the vibe they give/ their character. What I mean by all this is just because someone is “hot”, I wont like them. My favorite characters right now are Phoebe Cantarella and Phrolova. Phoebe is just giving me disney princess and I love her. Cantarella is one of the best designs Ive seen in a long time in any type of game. I love purple and I love umbrellas. She also gives sassy diva vibes to me (much like bayonetta). and phrolova is just interesting I guess. 

Zani on the other hand kind of gives me nothing :/. When they first released the drip marketing of Rinascita characters, I genuinely assumed that Zani would be the weakest link and did not even look twice. She looks fine dont get me wrong, but the only thing that was interesting I guess were the horns. I also kinda liked the outfit they gave her since we mostly have short dresses. Best believe it was kind of a shocker for me when I saw that everyone was obsessed. Nobody was giving a reason either. It was just “shes hot”. I feel like that is kind of the only thing going for her right now (at least before she makes her debut and we learn more about her.) 

Shes also slightly annoying imo. She keeps speaking about how she does not believe in the order and the only thing she wants being vacation days. In the 2.1 Vault quest, she kept giving weird answers to Phoebe. “Oh is that thing on you shining because Im not going to church?” “oh did i mention I dont like the order and dont go to church” “Oh also I dont like the order”. Like ok we get it. She until now has no real personality than just being a bodyguard (which is not a personality to begin with) and not caring about the order. 

So I am asking to someone that genuinely likes her: What exactly is the reason you like her?",1978,631,1742519449.0,WutheringWaves,Global_Client4889,0.87,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1jg523z/not_ragebait_genuinely_why_is_zani_so_popular/
reddit_search_1dumhs6,"WuWa's performance issues are caused by anti-cheat, not your PC","TL;DR: WuWa's anti-cheat - Tencent's Anti-Cheat Expert - is responsible for most of the game's performance issues.

**EDIT #2:** There is a potential workaround for some users at the bottom of this post.

I've had a lot of problems with WuWa on my PC, but they come and go. This has been a source of confusion for me. At first I thought maybe it was my PC - I was seeing the whole system stutter or lock up entirely or even bluescreen while playing the game, and normally a game can't make your whole system freeze or bluescreen. It's not supposed to be possible, and before playing WuWa I hadn't seen a BSOD in months or even years, let alone had a game cause one. I ended up replacing my whole PC, including my processor, GPU and SSDs! Nothing worked.

[RIP my computer. \\""Kernel security check failure\\"", huh?](https://preview.redd.it/bvbdbvoiqcad1.png?width=465&format=png&auto=webp&s=477ed2fa8a32b26c0ce100786954daa62486fa8b)

Some days I'd be able to play 4+ hours of the game without a problem, other days (like yesterday) my system would stutter or lock up every few minutes while the game was running. I lowered all the settings to minimum, turned particular options on/off like people suggested, no improvement. I tried ini file tweaks like people suggested, changing the cache and shader compile options etc, no improvement. I even tried forcing the game to use D3D12 instead of D3D11 (no improvement), or forcing it to use Vulkan (this doesn't work, they don't ship the shaders), or installing DXVK (anti-cheat blocks it). Nothing worked.

But I'm a professional game developer, so I thought - well, why don't I record a system trace and see what's going on? And the results of the system trace were interesting.

So for context, Wuthering Waves uses an anti-cheat system developed by Tencent called ""Anti-Cheat Expert"". Anti-cheat expert installs a system-level service (you can see this in the Services section of control panel, it's ""SGuardSvc64.exe"" that appears as ""AntiCheatExpert Service"", and it runs with OS-level permissions), along with a driver that runs next to your sound, video, mouse, network and other drivers, called ""ACE\_BASE.sys"". *^((EDIT: I previously listed the name of a different driver here - ACE includes multiple drivers.)**)*

I mentioned before that DXVK, a Vulkan-based implementation of Direct3D, is blocked by anti-cheat. Well, I noticed that the anti-cheat only detects DXVK once you log into the game, not when the game starts. **When you log into the game also happened to be the exact moment that system stuttering would start for me**. So I realized that if I focused on the point where the game is loading - when the system-wide stuttering was worst and most consistent, and where I got at least one BSOD - I could probably identify the cause of all my problems.

And wouldn't you know it, the #1 thing that shows up in system-wide traces during game loading is Anti-Cheat Expert. It's not the only thing hogging the CPU, but Anti-Cheat Expert is using as much CPU power as Wuthering Waves' game code and the Unreal Engine renderer **put together**:

[GPUView trace showing Anti-Cheat Expert activity while the game is loading](https://preview.redd.it/9gtq4oddqcad1.png?width=1787&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab13100ad9661257cd80b8bcf9acdc62da230219)

[CPU usage within wuthering waves grouped by responsible component](https://preview.redd.it/g1uql00fqcad1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1006ea97668731fb742fc65ff57cdd0810469df)

But normally, that would just make the **game** lag, wouldn't it? Why is my whole system lagging? Why am I getting Blue Screens Of Death that crash my whole system, with a ""kernel security check"" failure?

That's because Anti-Cheat Expert installs a kernel driver and a system-level process. The anti-cheat system is able to interfere with the functioning of your video driver (which will cause video playback in a browser tab to stutter or make your whole screen freeze), your sound driver (which will cause sound and music to cut out, which often sounds like the ""beep"" some players have complained about), your network driver (which will cause your in-game ping to spike or cause you to disconnect from services like Discord), or your mouse and keyboard. And because Anti-Cheat Expert intentionally hides itself to interfere with cheat tools, **most tracing tools like LatencyMon will blame other things - like your video driver - for this lag**. Worse still, if the anti-cheat driver is not written correctly - and I am now convinced it isn't - it can corrupt your system's memory, which will cause BSODs or in the worst case (if you were exceedingly, exceedingly unlucky) could even corrupt the contents of your hard drive. I have reason to suspect that happened to me, but that's another story...

So in summary, most of our technical problems with WuWa are likely caused by Tencent's low-quality anti-cheat system, and Kuro could probably fix them overnight by switching to another anti-cheat system. This reminds me of how when Resident Evil 8 came out, people discovered that Denuvo was causing severe performance issues... it seems like it's rarely the game at fault these days.

**EDIT**: Since originally writing this post, I did more testing using Driver Verifier and confirmed that the Tencent Anti-Cheat Expert driver does not pass driver verification if you play Wuthering Waves with the verifier enabled. It will cause a special form of BSOD, and the dump file generated by the OS fingers the culprit:

https://preview.redd.it/294gastp7ead1.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bcde43a7ac91e0ed011a6f7ee794a8105f69fdb

So at this point it's unambiguous that the anti-cheat system is doing things it shouldn't be doing, probably due to a bug.

**EDIT #2:** u/Mafste points out in [https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1dumhs6/comment/lbkkgmk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1dumhs6/comment/lbkkgmk/) that disabling 'USB Selective Suspend' in your Power Plan settings has historically helped reduce stuttering caused by anti-cheat drivers. For my system after a few hours of testing, it appears to make the stuttering a lot less bad. So if you're suffering from stuttering you can experiment with that option. Be aware it will increase the amount of power used by your PC! Based on this I looked a little closer at the contents of ACE\_BASE.sys and it indeed contains logic to examine your devices, so it makes sense that this workaround is effective.

But why isn't everyone affected?

* It could be caused by certain types of USB devices - a particular type of mouse or keyboard or USB headset
* It could be caused by certain types of USB controllers. Typically, there is a USB controller integrated into your processor's I/O die - [for example, the Ryzen 7950X has a built-in controller for 4 USB 3.2 ports](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-9-7950x.html) - and there is an additional one integrated into your motherboard that supplies additional ports. Either the CPU controller or the motherboard controller could have a compatibility issue with the anti-cheat.
* Whether USB Selective Suspend is enabled by default could depend on whether someone built your PC for you, whether you bought a pre-built, or whether you built it yourself. It could also depend on whether you upgraded Windows or installed it from scratch.
* Most importantly, the anti-cheat is connected to the network and 'phoning home' by design, so there's no guarantee that every user gets the same anti-cheat configuration. It's a known fact that some anti-cheat systems deploy different detection code to different players (EVE Online's for example, along with Granblue Fantasy's)

In any case, if that workaround helps you, definitely chime in with a response to their comment and give them a thumbs up.

Sadly this doesn't address the issue of BSODs, but it's still a nice workaround!

reddit_search_1k4d3y9,What people who complain about WuWa players “whining” about wanting more freebies don’t get is...,"...that we want to give Kuro Games our money. We just don’t want to feel cheated out of it.

I’m a spender - a dolphin - and I see the relationship between spenders and non-spenders like that of older and younger siblings. I’ve been with WuWa since pre-release. I’ve defended Kuro from bad press, promoted the game as more than just a predatory gambling-like, and praised it as a quality experience worth investing in. I’m level 80 with more resources than I know what to do with.

I stood by Kuro through early missteps, explaining development challenges to others, urging patience as the team found its footing. In terms of hope, Kuro was second only to Hypergryph on my list of good-faith projects - though the gap between #1 and #2 is like the difference between All Might and Endeavor, mind you.

I genuinely believe gacha games can be more than gambling - they can be collaborative experiences. Gacha to traditional games is like JoJo Parts 1–5 to Part 6: when Netflix dropped Part 6 all at once, it killed the weekly discussion culture that made the earlier parts so engaging. These games are about community, anticipation, and shared experience.

But what Kuro just did? That was dirty. I don’t know if Tencent’s putting pressure on them - given Tencent’s majority stake, it’s hard not to suspect it - but I struggle to believe the devs themselves would willingly alienate the community like this.

Was the early generosity just a pig-fattening scheme? WuWa has always done *just enough* to undercut Hoyo - an understandable strategy for a newer studio trying to gain footing. And I *want* to believe Kuro cares about the product. I want to believe they’re not just puppets for corporate execs chasing higher margins.

The first anniversary should’ve been a celebration - an opportunity to show the gacha and gaming communities what a great experience WuWa can be. Instead of a celebration, instead of a feast where f2p, dolphins, and whales sat at the table as equals, it became a feast for the spenders while f2p players - the backbone of the community - were tossed scraps and made to feel ashamed. The event felt like it was designed to squeeze more from those already paying, rather than celebrating *everyone* who helped the game thrive.

I won’t stand for the disrespect toward our f2p siblings.

If this is the direction Kuro intends to take the IP, then so be it. But I’ll be taking my time, money, effort, and goodwill elsewhere.",1578,448,1745240939.0,WutheringWaves,say_what_now-o_O,0.85,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1k4d3y9/what_people_who_complain_about_wuwa_players/

reddit_search_1f40i27,Mobile wuwa player is shocked a PC does what it's supposed to do (make the game look good),"I've been playing WuWa since launch on my cellphone exclusively since that was the most convenient for me to use since I had no PC to play it on and throughout that time I've seen many posts saying WuWa was made for the PC (graphically speaking) and I never understood that notion, until today.

Early in the morning our Internet service provider decided to kill itself momentarily and not supply us with sufficient network for a good 12 hours, in that span of prehistoric larping I decided that I needed to return to the computer because my school life revolved around it (I had a presentation due tomorrow and I was cramming my ass out today). So I did what any normal person would do and journeyed to find the nearest PC cafe. When I found it I went in there with the sole purpose of pursuing the academe. 

An hour later I find myself perusing the menu of this PC cafe and take a peek at their catalog of games— they had the usual, CSGO, Valorant, Roblox, Minecraft, Genshin Impact, the whole shebang... but what caught my interest was the spew of pixels strewn across the screen resembling YangYang's face with the letters below it spelling ""Wuthering Waves"". 

I was surprised, bewildered, even a bit shocked. So I boot up the game, enter my kuro account, look at the large screen infront of me full brightness while silently cursing at the 75% progression rate and then voila. I see my PC version of Changli in her full glory. 

I'll admit this is my first PC game and I was not that proficient with it. But my goodness did it feel satisfying to play. Without the pesky button layout distracting me and the combat befitting the PC version better, it was definitely an eye-opener for me. And the graphics were amazing in the PC version as well (even though it was set to medium this shit was like fire to me, everything looked wayyy better than the mobile version).

And so I did my dailies. The fonts were big, the screen was big, I could see Changli's mammaries in full high definition in 45 frames.

But, of course, all good things had to come to an end. Therefore, I bid farewell to that PC cafe and who knows maybe I'll splurge a little and start dedicating time to playing WuWa on the PC more often.

reddit_search_1kjv0tl,"After playing nothing but gacha games for the past year and a half, I played a formal video game and it was mind blowing","Im a pretty hardcore gacha gamer, I play like at least 7 or 8 different ones a week with a select few going into my daily rotation, and that means I haven't really had the time to play a formal video game for a while. 

I didn't really mind this, as the games I played at the time could still simulate that of a standard release game, and still genuinely enjoyed rolling and grinding for my favorite characters. 

Then the burnout hit about roughly six months ago, and it really drove my desire to continue with these games into the ground, but I would still force myself to play if only to get a twisted sense of pleasure out of it. 

Fast forward to roughly three weeks ago and im stuck on a plane for 8 hours with little to do, so I decide to pull out my switch and boot up Okami, a game I had bought a while back but never got around to, if only to pass the time. 

And, as the title suggests, it blew my mind. 

Turns out in my nearly two year long endeavor I had forgotten what it was like to play a non-gacha game by conditioning myself to ignore all the bad aspects gachas throw at their player base in order to make money. 

It was a sensation like no other, and honestly, I'd recommend it to people if the process wasn't so torturous. It makes you appreciate the little things in games, and for me it was Okami's absolutely amazing art and story. Sure maybe it doesn't compare to somthing like Genshin or Wuwa visually, but the art style was just so charming and as a sucker for any kind of mythology the story was really interesting for me. 

I don't plan on quiting gacha games any time soon, but I've definitely cut back on them since that day in favor of playing more standard titles. 

Moral of the story: Balance is Key and Too much of one thing can be really bad for your health

But considering how other gacha games such as HSR and upcoming gacha games such as HOKW have a very good ratio, its logically better to give them our money compared to wuwa. I mean u can S6 a new male character even without the BP. I just spam the skip button when its a female character story and the daily stuff takes like 10 mins, like a maximum of 2 hours or something if its a new area. 

I guess the sad part is that no other gacha is like wuwa to a lot of us, so we can’t help but make it our “main” gacha game. At least when a new male character comes out, we can take a breather from our main gacha games and indulge ourselves in enjoying the new male and his story for like a month or so before doing the 5 min daily grind and screwing off. I know a lot of people left, i left too after camellya but we know for a fact that a lot of people who left will come back for scar and genshu lin, would you rather grind like 4-5 days like a madman and having half the astrites that the normal players do and not getting the S3 or some shit of the new male or u can just spend 5 mins doing the daily grind and even possibly get the R5 of the new male ? 

I am not encouraging husbando pullers who want to leave to stay, that’s on you but i am just saying…its time to accept and scrap off the game like a vulture till the new male comes out so you can at least get to use him the way you want to instead of being stuck using the S0R1, i would have definitely pulled brant’s S3 if i sticked around after camellya but i couldn’t.

Certain attack in this game leaves your character at different point in your m1 string. This is not explained by the tutorial or the skill description  
The reason this is important is because some character has mechanic thats tied to certain part in their m1

For example  
Danjin has a 3 part basic string. Pressing E twice after her second basic activates the mark combo. Pressing E thrice after her third basic activate her tripple slash combo  
What is not explained is that **her raw E actually put her next basic in the SECOND part of her string**  
This allow you to do E A E E for a mark combo. Players who doesnt know about this mechanic might do E A A E E and be confused as to why the tripple slash is comming out, and not the mark

Another example is spectro rover  
he need to time his third basic into a special attack that fills up his passive guard  
Swapping in without an intro skill will automatically do the SECOND basic. This can cause player who are ignorant to mess up the timing on his basic string

Just saw a discussion about how they think this game was way over its head trying to surpass the likes of genshin or hsr. They used the sensor tower revenue thing as an example of how it failed. Weak argument, I know, it's still top 3 which is huge, but I couldn't help to think of what could've been...

The thing is, it definitely had the potential to do so. Incredible characters. Insane attention to detail. Animations. Combat. And among other things it did so damn right.

But unfortunately it also did so much wrong. Among the various dramas and the catastrophic launch week (which we surivved thankfully), the biggest blow to the game's populariry has had to be because of poor optimization. 

It's insane that a gacha game supposedly designed for mobile barely works on even the higher end devices. And the lower end ones simply just cannot play it. I have friends who are not huge on PC gaming but love gachas, who were hyped as hell for this game but ultimately couldn't play it and gave up. So much potential playerbase just gatekept out of the game because it's simply impossible to play.

Please, kuro. Fix your game. At this rate your game will die out really fast if it does not address this. I do not want to see this happen.
 
Introduce even lower settings. Hold back a little on attention to detail. Just make the game playable for more people.

EDIT: Alright so a lot of people seem to suspect that I'm complaining about the game because I cant play it because of my device. You have missed the point of the post completely.
I assure you this is not the case. I am UL51 on PC and the game is perfectly fine for me. This post was never about myself, but the unignorable large part of the community that is unable to play because of their mid tier devices. This was never a problem for genshin mind you. Pc or mobile, high or low end, it still ran. Being so accessible is part of why it got so huge. This is NOT the case for wuwa.

reddit_search_1kaw6aj,"Wuwa has jaded me, anyone else feel the same? (Warning: Long rant about modern gaming and gacha in general)","I would like to preface that I am a gay man and a veteran gacha game player of 10+ years, and a gamer of 20+ years. In gacha games I don't just pull for husbandos , I love badass women in games that also embrace that femininity (Bayonetta, or Lightning from FFXIII as an example.)  And I am no stranger to skewed gender ratios and fan service....but after playing Wuwa up to this point, for some reason all of that just sticks out more like a sore thumb to me. Before, I could play gachas without really paying attention to gender ratio, and fanservice in games/gacha games was no where near as egregious as it is today.  
  
But now when I feel like starting a new gacha I can only think about the gender ratio and how things are so heavily leaning one way in fanservice. These games will dump money into animation, CG and these very well rendered cutscenes to try and distract from a shallow story with no depth. Gacha games back in the day went two paths. Have an amazing story with great writing that kept the player invested, or have power creep that is so ridiculous that it forced people to spend (this also sucked.) Now that gacha has become mainstream, the games have just become ""what is the most optimal way for us to create these sex objectified female characters to get men to spend their money."" There is way less emphasis on quality of creating an amazing story and it's sad that many games are created with all flash and no substance.

Another problem is the mainstream gaming industry being shifted to be live-service game centric. With the rising popularity of live service games, a lot of companies have been foregoing developing full priced games in favor for slop that they can monetize heavily. I mean who can blame these companies? They can make a one time priced game of $70 that takes years and years of hardwork to create. OR develop a game for slightly shorter time and make way more money with a live service that will go on for years. All they have to do is regularly update the game with maintenance content and continue to rake in the cash for lower effort than creating a game from scratch once again. I can without a shadow of a doubt say that if some of these gacha games were just full priced rpgs with an emphasis on story and writing a good narrative, I would've loved them a 100x more and actually enjoyed them.

The last thing that bothers me a lot is the disgusting amount of gross, sexual and objectifying comments in the gacha communities (and anime community) made about these female characters or literal little girl characters. I don't care if that makes me a ""tourist"" that needs ""filtering"". That shit is not normal and okay, period. I don't care if your loli character is technically a 100 years old, I don't care that it's a fictional character, it's still a depiction of a child and that shit is GROSS and not okay in any shape or form. And in addition to this, women are not a pair of tits and ass on legs! Gaming communities in general have always been an echo chamber that has normalized saying the most awful and degenerate things. The gaming community has always been a cesspool of misogyny, homophobia and racism. But for gacha, you can now tack on porn addiction, gambling addiction, pedophillia and misandry (which is ironic when straight men are the target audience.)

TL;DR: 90% of gacha games evolved into gathering wives, modern game companies have sidelined full priced games and rpgs for slop, and the gacha gaming/gaming communities are awful as usual.",161,28,1745953753.0,GachaHusbandos,Ok_Release_8340,0.98,https://reddit.com/r/GachaHusbandos/comments/1kaw6aj/wuwa_has_jaded_me_anyone_else_feel_the_same/

I was stranded in the Arctic. Frostbite was setting in. Snow piled up around me, falling in a flurry. I had lost all hope of salvation.

Then, inspiration struck. I opened up Wuthering Waves. Immediately, my phone went from freezing, to a burning fire of unoptimisation. I loaded in. My phone went nuclear. All the snow around me melted, and my body began to unthaw. 

I knew time was short; I had a mere few minutes before the game would inevitably crash. In a last, desperate attempt, I tried to use Yinlin's ult, and threw my phone into the air. It promptly exploded, lighting up the sky and alerting the search group of my location.

I’m now safe at home, and eternally grateful. Thank you Kurogames. WuWa saved my life.

reddit_search_1i6l368,"""The game is so generous"", but what's the catch?","If you visited any gacha community, chances are that you heard the phrase ""This game is so generous"" at least once. Usually this is said because of high ammount of pulls or some gifts from the devs.

However, we're talking about Gacha, games build around predatory practices regardless of their quality. So whenever the games are being generous, there's always something that goes against the generosity, wether it's FOMO, powercreep or something else.

So what is ""the catch"" in the games you play?

To start, I'll list some examples

Honkai Star Rail

* two new 5\* per patch
* occassionally more than 2 reruns per phase
* a character (especially DPSs) could be powercrept within 5 patches

Nikke

* New SSR every 2 weeks
* New Players have to go through the 160 wall, which can take months to clear even with free SSR from anniversary
* Lower rate than normal for Pilgrims

WuWa

* Guaranteed Weapon Banner, but the best 4\* alternatives severely worse than even Standard 5\* and sometimes with undesirable conditions (based on prydwen and community posts)",1221,1064,1737473251.0,gachagaming,War-Inquisitor,0.94,https://reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1i6l368/the_game_is_so_generous_but_whats_the_catch/

reddit_search_1d49ajz,This game gets way too much hate,"So... For the first time after 3 years, I decided to leave r/gachagaming. Yeah, some of you might be wondering how I was able to stay there for so long. It used to be a sub where I could get news, info about gachas and overall, info that was relevant. 

After Wuthering waves released, the sub  (gachagaming), has been a toxic cesspool. All they ever talk about is wuthering waves and every single thing they try to nitpick and find only the problems and issues.s I've hardly seen one post there talking about the good. Those who have had good things to say are downvoted to oblivion and you start to wonder what exactly is going on?

Now, I get it. Some people memed, said WuWa was gonna be the you know what. Sure I get there's room for some fun and memeing. Genshin is a great game, I personally haven't played since 2021 for my own personal reasons, but there is no doubt it is a great game. However one thing I have noticed on social media (twitter, Instagram and even here) has been the waves of hate sent towards WuWa, but I also happen to notice it has mainly been from current genshin players. 

I'm sure not all of you genshin players are like this, but unfortunately the vocal minority sometimes gives the impression that everyone is like that. Both games are great in their own right. I'm not saying wuthering waves doesn't have it's problems. The stuttering, weird translations, skill info issues and some other stuff, but you can't deny that overall it is still a very decent game with tons of potential. It's just sad that the way some people are going on about this, you'd think that this was as bad as tower of fantasy was perceived. The Devs are trying from what I'm seeing.

reddit_search_1iaaaps,"Just completed Amphoreus and man oh man, the story is sooo good. Personally, its over a 9/10.","TLDR: This update deserves at least a 100/10 and HSR deserves our apology.

When I first saw people's criticism of the 3.0 story, I was deeply disappointed, not just at the haters but also at the people who liked the story. The reason being that the ratings of 9/10 are simply TOO LOW and it demonstrated their failure in grasping how masterfully crafted the storyline and gameplay of the 3.0 update is.

First off, the plot twist of Castrum Kremnos left me speechless. Throughout the storyline, the people of Kremnos were described as fearless warriors who do not fear death, warriors who do not resort to underhanded tactics to win, giving me the impression that they are more fond of direct battles. However, as I entered their competition, it seemed to me that the people of Kremnos really like doing puzzles. It seemed to me that their favourite past time is rolling boulders to break wooden boxes. This demonstrated the HSR team's mastery in writing and worldbuilding as there are no lack of surprises under their sleeves.

Speaking of surprises, everytime when you thought you could finally fight the titan, the devs managed to squeeze in at least 4 more sequences of puzzles or errands for the player to get through. So much so that by the time one manages to get through all of them, one would truly be able to embody Nikador's virtue of tenacity. Very immersive.

As for Gnaeus, some people complained about how for such an important character, he looked like a generic NPC. HOWEVER, it is exactly because he looked like a generic NPC that he put every players in awe when his spotlight came. Because at that point who could've known that he was an important NPC. While 3rd rate games like Genshin, WuWa and ZZZ waste money creating new NPC models and outfits from scratch, the HSR devs gave us a generous showcase of their ingenuity by showing these 4th rate games how you can both cut corners and enhance the quality of the story.

Another thing to note is how accomodating the game is in the puzzle sections as characters constantly tell us ""a door has opened"" or how ""path is clear"", ensuring that even the blind could fully experience this masterpiece of a game. Truly, the HSR team have considered everything under the sun when designing these intricate puzzles.

Other than the writing team, the marketing is also very impressive. By making the rooms big, putting puzzle mechanisms at opposite ends of the room, forcing players to spend ample time running up and down staircases, the marketing team managed to implement a feixiao advertisement into the gameplay. Very impressive.

Overall this side quest was so good, it can probably go toe to toe with the aranara quest next door. This warrants at least a 100/10 for this update.

With such a high production value for a side quest, I am very excited to see what the devs have in store for the main story of 3.0 later.",2012,332,1737884069.0,HonkaiStarRail,yappy3,0.86,https://reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1iaaaps/just_completed_amphoreus_and_man_oh_man_the_story/

Message for the launch of Wuwa 2.0

Hello everyone,

Yesterday, 2.0 Rinascita that the team was preparing for a long time finally reached the players. Here, I would like to share with you yesterday's performance.

First and foremost, the new version exceedes the expectations of the players, we got a lot of positive feedback from the community and surveys. The players can feel that 2.0 made a lot of progress compared to previous versions both in content quantity and quality.

As for performance, I'm happy to tell you that Wuwa has reached a new single day revenue high since launch, hitting a new milestone. Of course, beside the word of mouth and turnovers, we see that it's just as important that players can see and feel a confidence in the longterm operation of the game and the team can continue providing them with high quality content that exceeds expectations in the future, w.hich is a great encouragement to the team.

We have always said that the results we can output at each stage of development should always fairly match what our current capabilities are. As the saying goes, you get what you sow. As long as we remain pragmatic and seek progress, continue to persevere, we will surely be able to create even more surprises to the players.

Finally, I am very happy that we can make a ""growing game"" with you all!

reddit_search_1kgtsf2,The new element system exist only for not let new support buff old charachters and it worries me.,"Gameplay wise it change nothing its just another name for the same type of damage, but is just made to not let you buff your old characheters.

This is Ciaccona outro ( her kit is in the game if u check the resonators page ) : 

Aero Erosion DMG increase by 100%

This is Aalto : 

23% Aero Dmg Deepen

She could have been a premium version of Aalto, with like a 36% Aero Dmg Deepen, that can be used with any wind type of unit like Jihan or Aalto itself if played DPS.

By adding the elements, which again at gameplay level change nothing, they made the new supports usable only with new resonator.

Pheebe suffer the same fate :

10% spectro def and 100% frazzle increase.

While the 10% def reduce is good again old spectro dps like Jinshi or SRover cannot benefit of her outro skill.

If this keep going with all the element ( and lets be honest it will ) we will get a more restrictive kits and team comp every patch, with even more restrictive weapon buff, Stringmaster or changli weapon are goat but only Phebe can use her own weapon.

A new support in gacha can elevate an old charachter to the same level power of the new ones, but wuwa it seem is going in another direction with the supports by making them usefull with only the new units they realesed.

Honestly i dont like where this is going and I am kinda worried for the future units.

reddit_search_1czr0sc,I sincerely hope Kurogames/Wuwa face massive success after all this,"It's already been expressed on both sides, where some players genuinely enjoyed all aspects of the game and were shocked to see social media feedback on it. Some had a bad experience, the audience a mix of constructive criticism and pure complaints. 

I've been a silent observer until now but with all the freebies Kuro has been giving out (heck you get over half of the standard banner characters for FREE), I'm really praying hard that their efforts don't go so unnoticed. Companies in general with great customer service is a HUGE green flag in the long run, and I just want to give that some appreciation (no matter how small).

Maybe it's just me but despite the amount of attention KuroG has been giving to feedback and action taken against it, I tend to see more dismissive responses to their efforts or a ""who tf cares, these bug shouldn't have been there in the first place"". Baldur's Gate 3 still have massive bugs every major update and their customer service is just as great. Hopefully this isn't a method purposely done to coax more freebies from Kuro, rather more contructive criticism to encourage a better gaming experience. At this point, I'm genuinely worried about their profits since I want them to do so well so badly :') (but if anyone knows, do enlighten).

So I thought ""what if Kuro makes every character's gender/sex switchable""

Let's say in the story characters have their default gender but once a character is playable you can switch their sex/gender, like a skin...

I got this idea from seeing some character genderswaps in Twitter (as shown above) and from seeing Love and Deepspace's tremendous mobile revenue despite only catering to female gamers.

I know no gacha game has ever done this before but it puts more control in the player's hands as we can simply pick what gender we want our characters to be and it would satisfy both sides and more money in Kuro's pockets...wouldn't it?

I know gender and gender expression is a controversial topic but I like both the men and women in Wuwa.

reddit_search_1k9u2oj,(Ex)-Whale opinion on the game (and drama) so far.,"I’ve tried some Gachas before, but WuWa was the first title that really held my attention beyond day one. Most gacha games lean so heavily on their banners that pulling new characters becomes the only “meaningful” content—what’s the point if there’s nothing engaging to do with them? WuWa stood out with its satisfying combat system, awesome bosses (the Holograms especially), and a genuine sense of exploration. The Echo system sealed the deal for me: customizing your character and filling up your Data Bank felt rewarding in a way that traditional pull-and-power-up loops just aren’t.

When the Yinlin banner dropped, I didn’t hesitate to whale her to max as she fit perfectly with Calcharo whom I mained, and which is still my go-to team. I picked up all the standard five-star weapons, at least 1 or 2 sequences for most characters, and even indulged in a few extra sequences when they actually added something fresh to my gameplay. I’m not a leviathan whale, but I certainly don't mind supporting a game I love. But a few patches back, I hit a tipping point where I completely stopped spending. I saw the quality slipping and started to be convinced the devs valued profit over player experience, and recent drama only confirmed it.

The first red flag was the stagnant 20 percent Echo drop rate. For a game built around collecting and customizing, leaving that rate untouched feels like a slap in the face. My favourite patch was still 1.1, when the new region dropped, we got new Echoes and we got guaranteed 5-star Echoes from drops when you maxed out your DB. Sadly we won't get any further improvements it seems and now have to be stuck at a low 20% rate, while most Echoes still have 2-3 possible sets and at least 3 main stats, so you can calculate yourself how frustrating it is to farm them. (Doesn't even take into account the abyssal sub-stats, though this is another topic entirely.)  
  
Another thing that made me pause spending was the new bosses stopped fun and became frustrating: they hover out of reach or dash across the arena at random, which with characters like Calcharo or Jiyan that have timers on their Ultimate is just actual cancer to fight. It’s one thing to challenge players, but punishing invested characters just because they happen to fly or blink away makes you question why you spent so much time—and money—leveling them.

Then they pulled Illusive Realm, arguably the best mode in the game, and replaced it with more disposable, event-style content that screams mobile game (like a fishing event in a combat game, that shit was ass I'm sorry). Every new update reminds me of how much the game has shifted toward a wallet focus. Meanwhile, supposed quality-of-life improvements are little more than cosmetic tweaks—“Oh look, Tacet fields reset automatically now!”—while core requests like removing boss spawn invulnerability, Echo QoL, more four-star characters or real four-star weapon variety still aren't even talked about.

Now here’s the thing about the greed when it comes to prices and gifts: unlike casinos, which face real risk when players win, Kuro loses nothing by giving out virtual characters. Once a new character is created, distributing copies costs them almost nothing, yet they cling to stingy pull rates as if each five-star costs actual gold bars. Most whales spend regardless—but if they offered a better guarantee for your 100 bucks, they'd probably get more whales in the first place. The only reason I maxed out Yinlin, was because the top-ups guaranteed me at least to pull a 5 star for 100 bucks and while it objectively is still too expensive, I would be fine with getting a 5 star or his weapon with 100 bucks. My brother is a whale as well and a friend of mine is a dolphin that also only spent because of the 100 buck top-up and BP and Lunite pass afterwards. My brother still whales, but even he agrees that he would spend more if the prices would still be like with top-ups.  
  
It’s maddening to see so many asskissers defending Kuro like they genuinely care about our well-being. They don’t; they care about money, and it’s high time the player base recognizes the leverage we have. Especially since I whole-heartedly believe that many ways to earn more money would be by giving out more and reducing prices, since unlike an actual company having supply-demand problems when too many people buy and they need to pay more for resources and workers, videogames don't have the problem (at least not that noticebale) since they don't need to produce ""more"" characters the same way a bakery needs to produce more bread to sell. Like they chose to make prices for characters that expensive, they chose to be a gacha company, and if they as the seller are greedy, we as the buyers should demand the quality that comes with these kind of prices or lower prices in general. Kuro isn't yet at the point where Genshin is, where they can do whatever they want and still get support, I hope we won't be licking their boots for giving us crumbs when they have the tools to give us more.

To summarize my entire post: I love WuWa’s core ideas, but Kuro doesn't deliver the quality that should come with the amount of money they get. They should either actually start to listen to MAJOR complaints that actually mean something, lower prices if they are too lazy to do so or accept that they will get hate, and in this case deservedly so. I want to spend on this game again, because the concept was perfect to me, but sadly right now I feel let down by Kuro.

reddit_search_1ix2ape,GameLook - Kuro income up 243% and an overlook of the state of the game and community,"# Revenue

With the start of 2.1, Version 2.0 ended so we can look through how it performed. While many were anxious over the sales of the game because of its placements in stores, an internal letter from Solon Lee leaked, saying January 2 was the highest single day revenue of the game since release, which led to discussions in the player community.

Gamelook's own conclusion at the time was that Wuwa's revenue stream was gradually increasing with more people playing on PC and judging by experience and player feedback, that might be the case, as the game quality in Wuwa 2.0 has a trend to gradually align more towards PC and console games than mobile.

Now that more than a month passed, if you review Wuwa 2.0 again, you will find out that some of these conclusions were verified. According to SensorTower, Wuwa's global revenue surged nearly three times in january with Kuro increasing 243%.

https://preview.redd.it/s1roybjs43le1.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=176cea96ff33f6e681ea1616d3fcbd19f0d2e306

According to the platform, Wuwa's global mobile revenue for january was around 300-350 million yuan. (40M USD) Which if accounted for a 1:1 mobile and PC split would be double. This result is second only to the server opening. At the same time, Wuwa also ranked third in the global, with only Genshin and StarRail above it.

This alone enough to verify Wuwa 2.0 was a success and judging by the upward curve of Version 2.0, the q.uestion is if the subsequent versions can maintain the momentum. In terms of today's (February 14) Version 2.1, Wuwa was ranked 11th on the best selling list on CN iOS, the same rank as 2.0 was. In terms of overseas market, it has also entered the Top 10 in both Japan and Korea (9th JP, 7th KR).

[CN iOS ranking](https://preview.redd.it/muvbb8kr53le1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=561be610a7142b55883b1ee3222cae2964fdd0ab)

# Version 2.1 and updates

But what's important is Kuro showing that Wuwa will still rise higher, with constant follow-ups on game quality assurance. Taking this Version 2.1 as example, in addition to the regular new characters, new story, activities, they also add the RTX feature for PC.

[RTX Feature](https://preview.redd.it/hpnqmt9663le1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=40108f8df3aeaee7619bea2bc4bffcdaa82b2df5)

In addition, Wuwa also start their own Cloud Wuwa test in this version. While most early optimization and performance problems were solved already on mobile, Wuwa is a very high performance game with demands, so Cloud Wuwa will be a relatively good solution to some to ellaviate this performance requirement in mobile devices.

Other big games on the market, like Mihoyo's and NetEase's games already had cloud versions for some of their games, so in this aspect, Kuro is keeping up with the competition and market.

[Cloud Gaming in CN for now](https://preview.redd.it/geg4hroq63le1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a27ed65331f9c503f6991e88bb06ce93121b903)

In addition, it was officially announced that Wuwa will release on Apple Mac on March 27.

[Apple Mac release on March 27](https://preview.redd.it/hcbgm70w63le1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7afc55355b622d43fbb4f0b3af3dffd738a7b620)

Regarding this, Apple already showcased that they want to invest more into the gaming market on WWDC Global Developers Conference last year in June, where Apple showcased Wuwa as one of their representative ""high quality games for Mac"" in their presentation.

[WWDC Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/x1b7s3v673le1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=31445c445ac059bcdf16847758297e97c0a05f10)

It's difficult to say how much Apple will invest in the gaming business on their platform. It might give Kuro some short term revenue, while another option to play for the gamers is never a negative. On that note, with the launch of 2.0, Wuwa released on Playstation too and catapulted up to 2nd place in the JP PSN. Now, even a month later, it's still in the Top 10 which would count as a successful launch, indicating a good foothold in the JP console market.

[JP PSN](https://preview.redd.it/ofzaec0q73le1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=61cf026399a524f697e8de0592f21cb6abc0d53f)

Wuwa also won the Playstation blog's Players' Choice award for january releases, thanks to player votes.

# Player Reception

After the initial release of 1.0, the reaction to 1.1 with Jinhsi and Changli as characters and Mount Firmament as a new zone so soon was seen more as a ""trying to save the game"" in the player community in a negative sense, bringing forward the map and highly liked characters because the game was doing badly and player retention failing.

However, this time in 2.1, the production team revealed Riccioli Islands and the Underground Vault as the map in stream and at the end, showed off a small PV revealing four versions (V2.0-2.4) with three new characters.

[CN stream chat reaction](https://preview.redd.it/qblzif2t83le1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f4c1bcbfd85048fc404bbaa8e1ce3b0f00eafdf)

The reception was very good and cemented in the community that Wuwa stays, will improve and most of 2.0-2.4 is already done in advance if they can give out roadmaps. It also gives proof to Solon Lee's words, who previously said that as long as the production team had new ideas to implement, the only thing stopping them is ""production capacity"" being insufficient, but they will do what they can, focusing on player needs first and on the content that satisfy players.

# Gradually improving community environment

Another thing GameLook observed is that the community vibe and environment drastically improved overtime. Of course, this doesn't mean insult flinging between games disappeared overnight, as that is impossible before the general gacha community environment improves, because extremist players will always fan the flames.

On the other hand, Wuwa community environment improvement might be attributed to there being more ""normal"" players. Compared to the chaos of the server opening, most official updates now discuss the game and Wuwa also gradually form their own second creation enviromnent of fan contents. Be it forum topics, changes people want, combat showcases, music videos...

[A fan video with 5 million views](https://preview.redd.it/ofkrywx6a3le1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=958ac5ff40538842ef7d83dc03ae6d83e7b120b3)

For example, one of the famous ""chasing husband in the snow"" picture meme originated from “Are\_A\_R” a Korean artist and spread everywhere in the community, getting updates with each new version, more girl joining the crowd for Rover's attention. The artist got massive follower count thanks to Wuwa and seems like she will be a regular creator for the game.

https://preview.redd.it/ul8y7dyha3le1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f73995dbead08c489c7d082187ed5d0b2738315

The other reason why the community environment might improved so much is thanks to many flaws disappearing from the game altogether that was present on launch. (mainly optimization and 1.0's relatively light plot) That period has passed thanks to the efforts of the production team, players can truly feel the game's progress over the last half a year in content quality and player experience. This also just shows that content oriented games, game content will always be the basis for success.

Of course, the community environment shouldn't be policed by the players themselves, the developers have to make moves to make it better too. For example, recently Kuro issued a statement regarding false rumors, clarifying informations and holding people legally accountable for their actions.

[Official documents regarding false claims on Kuro's account](https://preview.redd.it/pavcysmgb3le1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9587288a854bd99415873776065f35fe9d4da150)

All in all, it wasn't easy for Wuwa to go from the initial chaos to this over time. This is also one of the few good news in the increasingly big market on open world gacha games. GameLook hopes Kuro can show more in the subsequent operation of the game. Their understanding of open world, after all, judging from the situation of a number of flagship gachas coming in the future, will be essential. The high-standard and large-scale investment in open world gacha R&D has not yet been abandoned by publishers, and the open world gacha war is about to enter the second half in the coming years.

reddit_search_1j207ml,"PSA: Brant was NOT ""Nerfed"" (by Selkey)","**Please upvote this, because it's an important matter, that affects the public perception of both the character Brant as well as Kuro Games. Please help me stop this misinformation.**

Hello, my name is [Selkey](https://www.youtube.com/@SelkeyYT) and I make high level guides and quickswap showcases and general WuWa content.

**By definition, a nerf is an intended weakening of a character in a game.** This cannot be considered a nerf by definition, as there is no notice of this change being ""intended"", thus it can be concluded, that it is an unintended bug, that will be fixed.

# Video Version:

[PSA: Brant was NOT ""Nerfed"" (2:19)](https://youtu.be/hSLiopoqn6U)

I highly recommend watching the video version, to have a better idea of the visual proof, which is important for the conclusion. It's just 2 minutes anyway.

# Intro:

I wanted to make a short post/video to reassure everyone, that Brant is fine. Please, pull him and do not let anyone tell you, that he is now ""unplayable"" or ""the next Calcharo"".

For anyone that is not informed, Brant recently had an undocumented change on the live version of the game, which enables him to dodge counter mid air. **This change SLIGHTLY decreases his damage output.**

[The post that started it all.](https://preview.redd.it/0eqxpgb7wbme1.png?width=1379&format=png&auto=webp&s=c59081ad77247fff904cfe00f3691196d20600a5)

I want to make it very clear, **that I am 99% sure that this is a bug.** You can be almost certain, that Brant will be released without being able to use his Dodge Counter mid air. **There is no patch note, that documents this ""change"" on the live version of the game, so it is most likely an unintended side effect of their coding.**

# Why I strongly believe it is a bug:

[This is not it.](https://preview.redd.it/0etm2gvkwbme1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f8666293a49d8bdba007f85b9a63855c47ed654)

**Many people believe that this is an intended mechanic, but it isn't.**

**Here is the proof (credit to** u/Blanooman):

[Blanooman, MY GOAT \(everyone send him love in DMs\)](https://reddit.com/link/1j207ml/video/9z25so4twbme1/player)

In this clip we can clearly see that Brant is not only doing Dodge Counter after the first two stages of his Mid-air attacks, but also after Stage 3 AND 4.

**This is not intended. It's a bug.**

# What if it isn't a bug:

Even if the 1% chance does apply here and he will be shipped with this change, **do not worry, Brant is still fine.**

Let me explain:

1. Many boss attacks do not require a dodge input to be avoided by Brant. The impact of this change has been largely exaggerated because of the Lorelei boss specifically.
2. This change doesnt affect quickswap players at all, because you are invincible during swaps.
3. Even if you don't swap, the effect of this change is already very small and Brant can use multiple workarounds, to minimize the effect of this change even further. These workarounds are as simple as dodging twice or waiting, so they are casual friendly and easy.
4. These workarounds are not even necessary. If you just do the Dodge Counter, get grounded and press Skill, you lose a negligible amount of damage, a small amount of Forte gain and gain a small amount of Concerto instead. **This is the most overblown issue of all time.**

I will not talk much about the workarounds, that will probably not find any use anyway, [but here is a post by Blanooman](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1j0vojf/extended_brant_gameplay_with_the_new_midair_dodge/), who has greatly helped me with collecting information for this post/video. He explains in his post the workarounds in further detail, for anyone that is interested.

# Conclusion:

This change makes no sense at all and there are hundreds of better ways to nerf Brant, if that is what they wanted to do. The main consequence of this change, is that it makes his gameplay unnecessarily inconvenient. Nothing else.

Anyone that tells you that this makes him ""unplayable"", ""weak"", or ""basically Calcharo"". You are factually wrong. Losing 1-2% of damage in the worst case scenario, is not going to kill a character. 

**Because of the complete pointlessness of this change and the change happening mid live patch, we can conclude, that this is NOT an intended change. It is a bug.**

# My message to other content creators and the community:

The misinformation, that has been going around about this change is beyond disappointing to me. I have spent **a solid 8 hours** factchecking all the information I provided in this video/post. I strongly believe that the community deserves content creators, that value the time of their audience and provide them with correct information, which was carefully researched and confirmed true.

**I hope that everyone who was involved in spreading this misinformation, can learn from this situation and move forward providing a better service to the community. Content creators and consumers alike.**

*At the very least we made ABSOLUTELY SURE, that Kuro MORE than knows about this. (they know, trust me they know)*

# It is VERY important to me, that no harassment or harm will be sent to anyone that was involved in this. Please respect content creators, Kuro Games and their well being.

# I only wish to stop this misinformation from spreading.

[Lorelei is \\""misinformation\\"", Brant is me.](https://preview.redd.it/b8h1pta90cme1.png?width=1926&format=png&auto=webp&s=814c95496f77d39cf3d84f61cca478a3b9c84451)

reddit_search_1kc7max,I am NOT glazing WuWa or anything (coz I am still mad with their very little husbando releases) but at least they have ONE thing they got right that certain gacha games husbando fans would wish for.,"One thing that WuWa did right, which is **actually putting efforts** in designing male characters, especially their kits and animations. 

I am not going to mention the name, but some Gacha games from a certain company I know, quite literally have bias when it comes to designing male characters kit (at least as of right now) across all of their game. They are either got constant nerf during beta, released at the second half with very little marketing, or having a gameplay that is very hard to play with not so rewarding result. One of their recent practice right now is releasing 5* male character at the second half, then next banner after him is a female character who shares the same role and same playstyle as him, but significantly better with a lot of quality of life improvement the previous one doesn't have, with better result in performance, easier gameplay and significantly more budget in animation and marketing. 

At least in WuWa, despite their constant waifufest releases, they never seem to have bias when it comes to creating male 5* both in kit, animation, and marketing. Every single limited 5* male I know so far (only three though), have such a great kit, along with expressive and cool animation. They also vary in gameplay too, so far their playstyle has been rewarding with them being much more forgiving with equal reward. Their downsides are that **they got sidelined a lot in favor for this annoying harem agenda and there are very few of them as of right now, I mean really really few**, but in terms of these character kits somehow Kuro is always serious about it. They also do not overlap with the next character release. Xiangli Yao a DPS, released before Shorekeeper who is a healer, despite being free character his animation and kit are amazing. Brant doesn't have the same playstyle as Cantarella, and he was designed with a lot of thought, amazing kit his animation is, cinematic too *(If shields in this game have interruption resistance then I can't imagine how even more comfy and unstoppable this character would be).* The same as Jiyan, for a launching character this character is amazing in both kit and animation, very simple character with cool animations. 

Basically, in WuWa, when you play with male characters, you play as cool dudes, and give you this feeling of how cool they are. Like I said, it's not glazing post just pointing out what we got, and what we lost.

It's HORRIBLE.
I have been playing the game since the first day and it seems as if it's progressively getting worse.
I have a Oneplus 11r with Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor.
The processor is capable of playing GI in the highest possible settings at 60 fps with frames not dropping below 50 even while combat.
But when it comes to WuWa no matter the settings I choose it keeps lagging and the frame drops are crazy.
The load status even with highest settings is SMOOTH but it lags a lot and even when I use the lowest settings the result it still the same...LAGS AND FRAME DROPS.
When it comes to combat (which I believe is the best part about this game) I am getting like 8-15 fps.
I'm unable to dodge or parry the enemy attacks. One sec I see they are attacking me then there's the lag and the next sec I am down.
THIS IS SO ANNOYING FR.
The recent parkour event was a nightmare too bc of all of this.
And ngl...I hate the fact that they are not doing anything to solve these issues. 
They aren't even replying to the feedbacks.

reddit_search_1jsuccd,From “Dead on Arrival” to One of the Best Comebacks in Gacha History – My Journey with Wuthering Waves and Why Kuro Deserves Respect,"https://preview.redd.it/j1g60qv3x7te1.png?width=1367&format=png&auto=webp&s=f854c5b0cee0d0636df2dbf018e2f0b32b8209a9

I’ve been playing Wuthering Waves since May 27th last year, just a few days after its global launch. I really liked the post apocalyptic vibe of the game. I still remember booting it up for the first time and immediately noticed some problems. The game didn’t use my GPU properly — all the strain was on my CPU (Ryzen 5 4500), and I’d hear high-pitched warning beeps during cutscenes. My PC even *crashed* once. I was barely meeting the system requirements (GTX 1650 + 16GB RAM), and it was a little rough to run the game considering there was stuttering quite often.

But even through all that — the bugs, poor voice acting, terrible optimization, and overall scuffed launch — I didn’t quit. Not because I felt FOMO, but because I **genuinely enjoyed the gameplay**. It had *something* under the surface, and I couldn’t let go.

It’s was quite known that Wuthering Waves had an *awful* launch. It wasn’t just bad — it was borderline catastrophic:

* The game was buggy and unoptimized on both PC and mobile.
* The VA work was clearly rushed.
* It lacked proper streamer and community outreach — Kuro only sponsored a handful of big streamers, and the rest had to pick up the game on their own.
* And worse, they were running low on sponsorship funding, with whispers of the game heading toward **EOS (End of Service)** floating around within just months of release.

At that point, most players had moved on. But those of us who stayed saw something beautiful happen. The game stopped trying to chase clout and instead started to build a soul. Updates became more polished. The storytelling deepened. Events started having actual lore weight, not just filler content. Everything began to click.

But somehow… **they didn’t give up.**

Even while people mocked it as a “cheap clone,” Kuro stuck with it. Most companies would’ve panicked or cut their losses. Instead, they **doubled down on quality, stability, and trust**:

* The game slowly got optimized — to the point where my rig can now run it at **60fps on medium**, no crashes, no thermal warnings.
* They gave out **free high-value rewards**, including a limited 5-star like **Xiangli Yao** at 1.2 to keep us going.
* They didn’t bombard people with ads or push desperate promos — the growth was **organic**, and people started returning because the **game actually improved**.
* They added **PS5 support in Jan 2025**, **macOS in March**, and the **Steam version is coming** — no company invests in platform expansion if EOS is on the table.

Kuro didn’t just patch the game — they rebuilt its **reputation**, piece by piece. They **earned** back player trust through actions, not empty promises. Now, here we are in April 2025, and *Wuthering Waves*:

* Takes a place amongst other well-earning gachas despite a lot of the early doomposts of the game.
* Has a consistent player & streamer base every month.
* Even after earning rewards at TGA (2024) instead of becoming greedy, they just put out amazing patches (2.0-2.2 they all were so well-written at one point I even began asking myself ""Why are they doing all of this?"").
* Continues to offer **a premium experience for non-spenders** without heavy FOMO tactics, which is almost unheard of in live service games

Kuro Games didn’t drown out the criticism with flashy ads or constant reruns of trailers. They didn’t beg people to come back with cash shop events or influencer campaigns. They just… quietly went back to work.

Patch after patch, they made real changes:

* Voice acting was improved and re-recorded.
* The game’s optimization skyrocketed
* Bugs were squashed, movement felt smoother, loading times improved.
* And most importantly? They listened. Feedback wasn’t just acknowledged, it was *applied*.

And what truly sets *Wuthering Waves* apart? It’s one of the few live service games where **you can be a free player and still feel valued**. There’s no forced grind, no FOMO-inducing systems pressuring you to log in every hour, no predatory monetization traps. Just quality content — handcrafted, consistent, and respectful of your time.

The game didn’t rise from the ashes through luck. It clawed its way back with **consistency**, **humility**, and a relentless drive to do better. They didn’t throw ads in your face every week. They didn’t keep pushing for virality. They didn’t bait with cheap hype. Instead, they let the **game speak for itself**.

They were criticized, laughed at, called a cheap imitation. But here’s the thing: **people don’t spend on cheap copies.** They don’t stick with games that feel hollow. *Wuthering Waves* built its **own identity**. It became a true **underdog success story**. And now, nearly a year later, *Wuthering Waves* has found its **own voice, its own audience, and its own identity.**

I’ve been playing on PS5 more recently (which feels great, by the way), but I still boot it up on PC sometimes just to appreciate how far it’s come. What used to be a stuttering mess that crashed my setup is now a smooth, polished game with excellent world-building, storytelling, and combat. From time to time I spend money on characters not out of obligation, but out of respect to the designers for all the amazing designs all of them have.

So to **Kuro Games**, if anyone from the team ever sees this — from the bottom of my heart: **thank you**.

Thank you for not giving up on Wuthering Waves when most would have.  
Thank you for treating your players with respect.  
Thank you for creating a game that I genuinely look forward to playing every day — not out of obligation, but love.

reddit_search_1d51cwb,"r/WutheringWaves and r/gachagaming on fire after Kuro Games leaked Japanese player's emails, and failing to give any compensation to players despite false advertising","**Context:** 

Wuthering Waves is an open-world RPG gacha game by Chinese game developer Kuro Games released on 22nd May. It was very anticipated in the gacha sphere, with many Content creators labelling it as the ""Genshin killer"". Genshin Impact is another popular gacha game that has dominated over the past 4 years (similar to how people call every new MMORPG the WoW killer). 

Before the release, WuWa (Wuthering Waves) had two closed beta tests, one on March 2023, and February earlier this year. There was [much praise](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1bfe1yj/a_review_of_wuthering_waves_cbt_2/) for WuWa's gameplay and combat, as it was the main selling point of the game and what differentiated it from Genshin Impact. However, there was also a lot of [criticism](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1br92qk/anyone_else_worried_about_localization/) regarding the localisation of the game to English and other languages, with many noticeable spelling and grammar mistakes in-game. Kuro Games reassured the global player base by making an [NDA Closed Beta Test](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1btw63z/therell_be_an_nda_cbt_for_localisation_from_april/) for localisation. Of course, players of the previous closed beta tests responded positively and r/WutheringWaves users were happy to see Kuro Games listening to their community (a phrase that would later turn into a satirical meme in r/gachagaming). On the other hand, r/gachagaming users were concerned with how late it was in development for them to be doing another Closed Beta Test, with the release date only being a couple months away.

When WuWa finally launched last week, there was a massive number of optimisation problems, with many players [unable to play](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cyhp1d/okay_i_cannot_deal_with_this_game_on_mobile/) the game as well as numerous [bugs and dialogue issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cylvho/known_issues_bug_fixes/). Most players agreed that the launch was rushed with the English localisation still being subpar, the voice acting being [awful](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1d2elkf/maybe_voice_acting_direction_is_important/) and the dialogue and story being [bloated and boring](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cyi39m/dialogues_feel_bloated_and_blend_the_story_has/). 

**Drama:**

Weapons in WuWa can be purchased with in-game currency in the store, with each weapon having different effects. However, there was a [mistranslation with the Japanese text](https://x.com/hxg_diluc/status/1795849274682749361) concerning how to weapon worked in combat. Players in Japan were purchasing this weapon despite the Japanese text being different from the actual effects of the weapon. Some Japanese players planned to report Kuro Games to the Consumer Affairs Agency department. Kuro responded by giving 160 Astrites (their in-game currency) as compensation. For context, 160 Astrites is worth 1 'pull', and the number of 'pulls' required to get the weapon guaranteed was 80 pulls. 

WuWa players were shocked and disappointed with Kuro, especially since Kuro didn't improve the confusing text despite feedback from both Closed Beta Tests.

&#x200B;

>\> Damn they just can't catch a break huh?:/ This release really was rushed. At least 3 months   
   and I think it would have been golden. Now they are facing this which will end up in also   
   losing trust in players... Losing money and players at release is awful.  
>  
>\> Of course it is huge because it can be considered scam.  
  The serious thing is not that they are sued, the serious thing is that they lose the trust of the   
  Japanese consumer and they can tolerate anything including cashgrab games but they do not   
  forgive deception.  
>  
>\> Are they actually that dumb? JPN players that went for it very likely might not have done so   
  with the updated description. They will eat them alive: fuck is 1 pull gonna do when the   
  weapon might have costed 80 lol  
  
>  
>\> I'm genuinely curious as to how this even made it into production. Did no one in the   
  localization team, or the beta testers notice? That's their job 😭

After the backlash from JP players, Kuro decided to [issue individual refunds](https://x.com/hxg_diluc/status/1796218806328754295) to each player who tried getting the weapon, and told the affected players to fill in a form asking what kind of compensation they should receive, as well as their email. While r/WutheringWaves applauded the decision and [praised Kuro](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1d45vu9/regarding_that_mistranslation_on_jp_side_jp_has/) for doing the right thing, users in r/gachagaming were more sceptical of how Kuro would be able to refund each player since they were issuing refunds case-by-case and there were presumably thousands if not tens of thousands of players who had tried purchasing the weapon. 

[Link to the main post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1d45xn4/wuthering_waves_additional_response_for_weapon/)

&#x200B;

>\> Oh no…. Conditional compensation it seems.  
  Moreover, they literally ask how they should compensate.  
  Obscurity like this only leads to comparison of compensation down the line. I can’t see a   
  scenario where everyone is happy.  
>  
>\> Are they.. stupid?  
  Going 1 by 1 per email is infinitely more costly and time consuming than just implementing a   
  blanket change and something like a recall selector  
>  
>\> It seems like every other day, they need to compensate...  
   I'm curious though. Are they really going to investigate each case separately?  
>  
>\> This is good?  
   Does anyone know how the responses are?  
>  
>\> No it's not. It opens up Kuro for potential discrimination allegations if they give   
compensation   
to one person and deny another one with even the vaguest similarity in scenario. If they   
also  give varying kinds of compensation other than a full refund to everyone affecthat's   
also a potential discrimination allegation.

Fast forward to today, Kuro Games has now [leaked the emails](https://x.com/hxg_diluc/status/1796533273696628855) of the Japanese players who applied for compensation by mass replying to all of them without BCC. Additionally, it was later revealed that there was no compensation for JP players, and they were instead directed to [take it up with their payment platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1d4uyal/details_of_individual_handling_for_jp_weapon/?share_id=htPJhYR0kopovwMmvxbrE&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1). The ""individual compensation"" for the false advertisement did nothing for the affected JP players other than leaking their private information. Furthermore, this could lead to a potential lawsuit as private information in Japan is heavily protected.

r/WutheringWaves users are astonished and frustrated by the actions of Kuro Games, with some even claiming it was 'over' despite the game only being one week old.

&#x200B;

>\> At this point kuro is their worst enemy.  
>  
>\> This is catastrophic levels of mishandling the situation. Holy shit  
>  
>\> This is genuinely one of the most devastating fuck-ups in recent years in gaming  
>  
>  \> forget about wuwa living until the next patch, will it even survive to the next week  
>  
>\> KURO PLEASE, I JUST WANT THIS GAME TO SUCCEED PLEASE  
>  
>\> Dang, in addition to false advertising, data leak, now making customers deal with their   
  problem. I'm not liking this response.

Meanwhile, over in r/gachagaming, users are ridiculing and laughing at Kuro's recent mistakes, with the satirical ""Devs Listened!"" meme evolving to new variations.

reddit_search_1k3y1nq,Honestly Kuro Games is Way too generous with Their Anniversary Rewards. The community is Absolutely undeserving of their rewards,"**Honestly none of the rewards for the upcoming anniversary should be given to WuWa players and community, in fact they should be taken away from them with their behavior!**  
The past 24 hours after seeing all the backlash, which then turned into witch hunt from crazy Drama farmers and stuck attacking the only Content Creator in their community who actually made useful informative content around the game, created their damage calculator and everything while we then have all the crazy rabid WuWa drama community (**Saintontas, Tecktone, E-thin, Captain Cabinetz, Ryuuku Sensei, Faros, SkullCJay** and many more) copers going around doing damage control which then turned into them placing a target and witch hunting the math fairy. Honestly digging around in various discord servers, omitting timestamps, taking messages out of context all so they can prop her up as the next target and witch hunt her is absolutely ridiculous. I've known Maygi for the past 3 years, what many of you do not see is how things happen in private circles behind closed doors, and yes she does occasionally vent about how she feels on things, Heck She shits on basically every game out there as well for various different things, nothing is perfect. She's been attacked by the rabid community many times in the past for making any form of criticism on things, another thing you guys may not have known as well is that She actually hasn't been given Access nor NDA's to help her make content on WuWa since around 1.3, There have also been many mismanagement with the creator manager for Wuthering waves as well resulting in her occasionally. Heck she regularly sends them her own content to review every patch. They allowed her to post what she did but hey let's take everything out of context and hide everything from view.

reddit_search_1kb3u1v,This sub is becoming unbearable.,"I was going to type out a long post about how I get that some of the things Kuro have been doing lately aren't ideal, that they could be better but ultimately this is still a good game and we should stop being overly critical, but the shit I'm seeing is just ridiculous.

I genuinely don't know if I'm playing the same game as these posts man. 

""Zani is dependent on Pheobe, 1 billion DPS loss"". I decided to just test out Shore, S Rover, and Zani in first hazard ToA zone (Dragon) and it was over in 2 rotations. I have her S1R1, so I can concede that it might take another rotation without that, but I was done with 3:49 left. This was my first attempt without even tryharding, so if she can clear endgame content without Phoebe without any issues, what are we complaining about here? I'm not out here pretending like I'm the representation of the playerbase, but her DPS is completely fine, and the doomposts I'm reading are incredibly over exaggerated. 

""The anniversary patch is underwhelming"" (https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1katk1i/the_anniversary_patch_feltunderwhelming/). I get that this poster isn't hating on everything, but the wording is clearly negative and I need to vent. If you finished the ENTIRETY of the anniversary patch within 24 hours, you didn't find it underwhelming, full stop. And if you did, then you just have a problem that is not connected to the gacha you're wasting your life away on.

""Predatory event shop"". This one is an incredible display of self victimization. Kuro includes pulls in the event shop to get pseudo refunds when you're pulling, with a total of fucking 8 gated behind pulling. First of all, 3 of those 8 are gated behind 20 pulls anywhere, so if you aren't getting those then I don't fuckin know man. The last 5 are just that: 5 pulls. 5 fucking pulls man. Are we really salting out about this? Are we really pretending that this is some ploy by Kuro to get you to pull more and not just a nice bonus for people who aren't saving on the fucking anniversary? Acting like this is a predatory inclusion that's meant to draw pulls out of you is actually insane when nobody is going to pull up the event shop, see ""2200 currency required"" and think ""Oh, I was going to save my next 80+ pulls for Cartethia, but those 5 pulls are calling my name"". Get yourselves checked out.

I'm sure that this post is going to just get buried. I don't normally post because I'm content to just ignore shit like this, but I actually can't even believe that I'm reading all of this shit.

reddit_search_1kfruq4,Message From The Mods,"Just some things we wanted to address to the community:

## 1. Clarity On Our Ties To Kuro Games:

Yes, this is the official subreddit for Wuthering Waves. Yes, we have a Kuro Games staff member on the moderation team as well as a means to be in contact with them. That said, they do not participate in the moderation of the subreddit, enforce its rules, or have influence over our actions. 
No, we are not employed by Kuro. No, we do not have special access to test servers, information, etc. of any degree. When news drops regarding the game, we are made aware at the same time as you are. When the community is given rewards, we are part of that same exact community, so a win for the community includes us as well, we are not separate.

## 2. Addressing The Increase Of Harassment Towards The Moderation Team:

This mostly relates to modmails: there seems to be a thought process that because the person being spoken to is a moderator, one can attack them and still expect cordiality in return because anything else is unbecoming and would make for great drama on certain drama oriented subreddits. This moderation team has been called every insult and slur in the dictionary, attacked daily in modmail for simply upholding the rules, and gaslit by users who think they’re being clever by deleting the very comment that earned them a ban in the first place, as if we don’t log it, and then claiming they didn’t do anything wrong. 
I personally had a user, who was only temporarily banned for three days due to a clear violation of the rules, go out of their way to harass me. They spammed modmail, flooded my Reddit DMs, tracked down my Discord account to continue the harassment, and even went so far as to find and harass me on my personal social media. All of this just over a simple 3 temp ban. Despite that, I have believed that we should stay cordial no matter how frustrated we get. However, some individuals have repeatedly and deliberately tried to hurt us, as if there isn’t a human being on the other side of the screen. 
Going forward, we will not engage with harassment. If you attempt to harass or attack anyone on the moderation team when sending in a modmail, you will simply be muted.

## 3. Addressing Brigading:

It has become extremely obvious that there are certain individuals and groups who come here specifically to fan the flames. We especially saw a spike in this during the anniversary issues, even our subreddit analytics reported activity significantly out of the normal range and standard deviation. 
We are aware of these individuals to a high degree of certainty, but have allowed them to remain so long as they were “voicing their concerns,” as we believe everyone has that right. 
We do not allow our community to disparage other users, subreddits, communities, etc., because we believe that by being better individuals, we build a better, more welcoming community. 
However, at this point, if we have a very-high degree of certainty that you are here participating in brigading, we will issue a permanent ban. Consider this your final warning.

## 4. Addressing Leaks:

One of the core aspects we have maintained from the start is providing multiple chances when it comes to leak-related rule violations. Just simply on the basis that everyone deserves a second chance (within reason). However, leaks can cause serious damage, misconstrue community expectations, ruin experiences, and overall spread misinformation.
We will be revisiting this policy with stricter enforcement in mind. EDIT: to clarify this stricter enforcement is in regards with those infractions that are only attainable through participation in leaked content (e.g. someone describes a characters kit when they haven't even been shown in game)

## 5. Addressing Criticism and Repeated Posts:

Anyone who has been active in this subreddit can speak to its history of allowing criticism to be expressed, whether it was the recent anniversary controversy, the Tencent merger controversy, the female-male ratio controversy, the launch issues, etc.

Criticism is and always will be welcome here. However, when criticism overruns the subreddit, moderation becomes necessary. There does not need to be a wall of posts addressing the same issues with slightly different wording.
If a criticism post has nothing substantially new to add and could reasonably be a comment under an existing criticism post, it will be removed and redirected there. 

During the recent anniversary criticism that was taking place, we noticed that users who just wanted to post something completely unrelated to the anniversary, were having their posts mass reported and downvoted by the community because it did not fit with the negativity, and that should not be acceptable.

There also seems to be a misunderstanding that flooding the subreddit with repeated posts will make Kuro notice. In reality, the best way to reach Kuro is through the in-game feedback function. 

While this may be the official subreddit of the game, it is still an extremely minor sub-community of the greater overall WuWa community. Even with this recent anniversary drama, the moderation team put together the community's concerns and forwarded that to Kuro ourselves. 
This is not a drama subreddit, but yes the game will inevitably have drama tied to it, and we will let those issues be discussed and spoken about but within reason.

## 6. Addressing Emotes: 

This has been asked a few times by the community. After a long back and forth with Reddit, it seems that we have a hard limit of 20 personal emotes for the subreddit. As of right now we have hit those 20 emotes, however, in the future we may do a community based voting on which emotes we have for the subreddit.

## 7. Final Remarks:

I’m just going to address some random things I saw in some posts to bring forth clarity

* If you post something that is leak discussion, or based on information only available through leaks, even if it is just an hour before it becomes public, it will still be treated as leak discussion.

* Yes, we should leave a note when locking posts that require moderation intervention or when a moderation discussion is happening. We will work on this going forward.

* If a post consistently requires moderation intervention (i.e., generates a high volume of rule-breaking discussion repeatedly), we will lock it down. This is a practical necessity; we cannot divert all our attention to a single post while neglecting the rest of the subreddit.

* The reason why rules on the sidebar are not explicit is not just to umbrella cover situations but also because Reddit limits the character count and we have to convey the rules within those limits.

* u/WutheringWaves account is not a unique kuro games staff member, but rather an official account with the original intentions of direct communication from Kuro to the subreddit (announcements/events/etc) but as anyone can see it ended up not being used.

On that note, we are volunteers doing this in our free time. We cannot see every post and comment immediately. If you see something breaking the rules, please report it.

A recurring issue we encounter is rule breakers pointing to other unmoderated content as an excuse, but almost always, no reports were ever sent in. The rules apply equally to everyone, and 99% of the time, once something is reported, we moderate it promptly.

We ask for your help: if you see rule-breaking behavior, use the report function rather than using it to justify breaking rules yourself.

reddit_search_1dumhs6,"WuWa's performance issues are caused by anti-cheat, not your PC","TL;DR: WuWa's anti-cheat - Tencent's Anti-Cheat Expert - is responsible for most of the game's performance issues.

**EDIT #2:** There is a potential workaround for some users at the bottom of this post.

I've had a lot of problems with WuWa on my PC, but they come and go. This has been a source of confusion for me. At first I thought maybe it was my PC - I was seeing the whole system stutter or lock up entirely or even bluescreen while playing the game, and normally a game can't make your whole system freeze or bluescreen. It's not supposed to be possible, and before playing WuWa I hadn't seen a BSOD in months or even years, let alone had a game cause one. I ended up replacing my whole PC, including my processor, GPU and SSDs! Nothing worked.

[RIP my computer. \\""Kernel security check failure\\"", huh?](https://preview.redd.it/bvbdbvoiqcad1.png?width=465&format=png&auto=webp&s=477ed2fa8a32b26c0ce100786954daa62486fa8b)

Some days I'd be able to play 4+ hours of the game without a problem, other days (like yesterday) my system would stutter or lock up every few minutes while the game was running. I lowered all the settings to minimum, turned particular options on/off like people suggested, no improvement. I tried ini file tweaks like people suggested, changing the cache and shader compile options etc, no improvement. I even tried forcing the game to use D3D12 instead of D3D11 (no improvement), or forcing it to use Vulkan (this doesn't work, they don't ship the shaders), or installing DXVK (anti-cheat blocks it). Nothing worked.

But I'm a professional game developer, so I thought - well, why don't I record a system trace and see what's going on? And the results of the system trace were interesting.

So for context, Wuthering Waves uses an anti-cheat system developed by Tencent called ""Anti-Cheat Expert"". Anti-cheat expert installs a system-level service (you can see this in the Services section of control panel, it's ""SGuardSvc64.exe"" that appears as ""AntiCheatExpert Service"", and it runs with OS-level permissions), along with a driver that runs next to your sound, video, mouse, network and other drivers, called ""ACE\_BASE.sys"". *^((EDIT: I previously listed the name of a different driver here - ACE includes multiple drivers.)**)*

I mentioned before that DXVK, a Vulkan-based implementation of Direct3D, is blocked by anti-cheat. Well, I noticed that the anti-cheat only detects DXVK once you log into the game, not when the game starts. **When you log into the game also happened to be the exact moment that system stuttering would start for me**. So I realized that if I focused on the point where the game is loading - when the system-wide stuttering was worst and most consistent, and where I got at least one BSOD - I could probably identify the cause of all my problems.

And wouldn't you know it, the #1 thing that shows up in system-wide traces during game loading is Anti-Cheat Expert. It's not the only thing hogging the CPU, but Anti-Cheat Expert is using as much CPU power as Wuthering Waves' game code and the Unreal Engine renderer **put together**:

[GPUView trace showing Anti-Cheat Expert activity while the game is loading](https://preview.redd.it/9gtq4oddqcad1.png?width=1787&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab13100ad9661257cd80b8bcf9acdc62da230219)

[CPU usage within wuthering waves grouped by responsible component](https://preview.redd.it/g1uql00fqcad1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1006ea97668731fb742fc65ff57cdd0810469df)

But normally, that would just make the **game** lag, wouldn't it? Why is my whole system lagging? Why am I getting Blue Screens Of Death that crash my whole system, with a ""kernel security check"" failure?

That's because Anti-Cheat Expert installs a kernel driver and a system-level process. The anti-cheat system is able to interfere with the functioning of your video driver (which will cause video playback in a browser tab to stutter or make your whole screen freeze), your sound driver (which will cause sound and music to cut out, which often sounds like the ""beep"" some players have complained about), your network driver (which will cause your in-game ping to spike or cause you to disconnect from services like Discord), or your mouse and keyboard. And because Anti-Cheat Expert intentionally hides itself to interfere with cheat tools, **most tracing tools like LatencyMon will blame other things - like your video driver - for this lag**. Worse still, if the anti-cheat driver is not written correctly - and I am now convinced it isn't - it can corrupt your system's memory, which will cause BSODs or in the worst case (if you were exceedingly, exceedingly unlucky) could even corrupt the contents of your hard drive. I have reason to suspect that happened to me, but that's another story...

So in summary, most of our technical problems with WuWa are likely caused by Tencent's low-quality anti-cheat system, and Kuro could probably fix them overnight by switching to another anti-cheat system. This reminds me of how when Resident Evil 8 came out, people discovered that Denuvo was causing severe performance issues... it seems like it's rarely the game at fault these days.

**EDIT**: Since originally writing this post, I did more testing using Driver Verifier and confirmed that the Tencent Anti-Cheat Expert driver does not pass driver verification if you play Wuthering Waves with the verifier enabled. It will cause a special form of BSOD, and the dump file generated by the OS fingers the culprit:

https://preview.redd.it/294gastp7ead1.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bcde43a7ac91e0ed011a6f7ee794a8105f69fdb

https://preview.redd.it/y6sfvodt7ead1.png?width=1804&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c15d411210fc8c6cb2dc828db85bea93ff0b799

So at this point it's unambiguous that the anti-cheat system is doing things it shouldn't be doing, probably due to a bug.

**EDIT #2:** u/Mafste points out in [https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1dumhs6/comment/lbkkgmk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1dumhs6/comment/lbkkgmk/) that disabling 'USB Selective Suspend' in your Power Plan settings has historically helped reduce stuttering caused by anti-cheat drivers. For my system after a few hours of testing, it appears to make the stuttering a lot less bad. So if you're suffering from stuttering you can experiment with that option. Be aware it will increase the amount of power used by your PC! Based on this I looked a little closer at the contents of ACE\_BASE.sys and it indeed contains logic to examine your devices, so it makes sense that this workaround is effective.

But why isn't everyone affected?

* It could be caused by certain types of USB devices - a particular type of mouse or keyboard or USB headset
* It could be caused by certain types of USB controllers. Typically, there is a USB controller integrated into your processor's I/O die - [for example, the Ryzen 7950X has a built-in controller for 4 USB 3.2 ports](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-9-7950x.html) - and there is an additional one integrated into your motherboard that supplies additional ports. Either the CPU controller or the motherboard controller could have a compatibility issue with the anti-cheat.
* Whether USB Selective Suspend is enabled by default could depend on whether someone built your PC for you, whether you bought a pre-built, or whether you built it yourself. It could also depend on whether you upgraded Windows or installed it from scratch.
* Most importantly, the anti-cheat is connected to the network and 'phoning home' by design, so there's no guarantee that every user gets the same anti-cheat configuration. It's a known fact that some anti-cheat systems deploy different detection code to different players (EVE Online's for example, along with Granblue Fantasy's)

In any case, if that workaround helps you, definitely chime in with a response to their comment and give them a thumbs up.

Sadly this doesn't address the issue of BSODs, but it's still a nice workaround!

**EDIT #3:** I am happy to report that I am in contact with Kuro about this issue, though I don't know anything about what kind of progress will be made or how quickly it will happen.",6134,803,1720033730.0,WutheringWaves,kaelan_,0.99,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1dumhs6/wuwas_performance_issues_are_caused_by_anticheat/
reddit_search_1kwm9ka,Rover is not a self-insert here’s why. Artist: @aaapair (image),"Rover is not a self-insert, even if it might have seemed that way at first. But as the story progresses, it becomes clear that this is definitely not the case.He has his own goals, his own backstory, and makes his own decisions. All of this clearly sets him apart from the concept of a self-insert.
Rover doesn’t blindly follow quest directions  he’s not just a delivery guy. He makes his own choices, as we can see in updates( 1.0, 1.1, 1.3, 2.0, 2.2, and especially in the Ciaccona quest 2.3).

Even when we get to make dialogue choices, they actually matter. Unlike other gacha games where your choices don’t change a thing and the characters always respond the same way, in WuWa, dialogue really does change. It’s refreshing to see a game where your decisions can lead to bonus scenes — some of them amazing  that you can completely miss if you don’t pick the right option. That’s what real interaction feels like: you can’t see everything in one run, and it makes the experience feel much more genuine.

For example, a lot of players missed the chance to get a headpat from Zani( me too lol), or didn’t get Canterella’s marriage proposal just because of different choices. And there are plenty more moments like that. Since version 2.0, hidden dialogue like this has become more frequent. And since you can’t go back, it makes everything even funnier. But it’s never frustrating, because it’s all coherent: every player makes different decisions, and the journey feels personal.

Rover always has his own personality. And we, as players, have no control over some major decisions  like during the Aura farming for example.

The MC already has a major influence on the world, due to his past as the Lord of the Arbiters. Right now, we’re following a Rover who must surpass his former self — an aspect that hasn’t been fully explored yet, but it’s clear the game will develop it further later on.

And of course, as the protagonist, he naturally earns some affection from other characters  which makes sense. In real life, if someone is reliable, kind, and someone you can count on, they’ll naturally be appreciated. Sure, it can be exhausting sometimes, but it’s not unrealistic and in the game, that aspect is becoming less present, which is actually nice.

The gathering wives running joke will always be hilarious, but that doesn’t change the fact that Rover is not a self-insert.

Wuthering Waves really stands out because of all this. For example, Traveler in GSH can easily be seen as a light self insert. The MC from Tower of Fantasy is basically the blueprint of a self-insert

So, what do you think?

It's not nessesarily bad, developing and maintaing an open world game is really expensive, Kuro's other game doesnt do really well financially, with the up coming promotion campaign, they need a lot of money, Tecent has the money and resources, they are now even promoting wuwa on their own game app Wegame like their own games. And perhaps they would also help promote it world wide(my guess only). Tencent usually doesnt interfere unless the company's profit takes a deep dive. Still we need to wait and  see how it affects the company in the long run.

reddit_search_1kbzp7a,You Like It. I Don't. We Can Both Be Right. And That's What Makes Us a Strong Community instead of an Echo Chamber. Let's talk about Respect.,"Recent events have sparked intense debate in our community. We've seen [intense disapointment](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/s/jxY2CqpnGZ) and [shared frustration](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1k9ecpa/psa_zani_shows_the_increasing_greed_of_kuro_games/) at the direction of the game. Giving us all a [harsh reminder of the reality of Gacha Games](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1ka6g39/a_reminder_to_the_community_gacha_game_are_not/).

But the way we're treating each other? That's becoming an even bigger problem than the issues we're discussing.

* You have players attacking other players for expressing their dislike of recent events  [https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1k9w63t/this\_community\_is\_starting\_to\_get\_annoying/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1k9w63t/this_community_is_starting_to_get_annoying/)
* You have players attacking other players for NOT expressing their dislike of recent events [https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1kanvuo/to\_the\_people\_who\_have\_defended\_kuro\_these\_last/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1kanvuo/to_the_people_who_have_defended_kuro_these_last/)
* You have players attacking other players for expressing their opinion at all [https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1kb3u1v/this\_sub\_is\_becoming\_unbearable/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1kb3u1v/this_sub_is_becoming_unbearable/)

But here's the thing - we're all here because we care about the game. We just show that care differently by arriving at different conclusions. Which is only natural when you consider the diversity of players in the community;

* F2P vs Low Spender vs High Spenders
* Casual vs Regular vs Hardcore Players
* Players that grind/play for hours a week vs Players that don't
* Players pulling characters based on Looks/Fun vs Competitive Meta

Every single one of these approaches is valid. They're not competing paths - they're personal choices that make the game meaningful to each player. You don't have to share someone's opinion to respect why they hold it. But lately, we've forgotten how to disagree respectfully. Instead of discussion, we've devolved into insults. Instead of understanding, we've chosen hostility. **This needs to stop**.

Stop trying to force others to agree with you. Stop trying to silence opinions that you don't agree with. And more importantly, stop basing your enjoyment of the game on other people's opinions. This goes BOTH ways - we're seeing it from all angles. For example: Players who like Zani who actively sweep issues under the rug and call others who do ""doomposters"", or Players who dislike Zani raining negativity on people who still like her and play her causally. They are different, but equal types of toxicity that dismiss player feelings and objective facts about her problematic kit.

A strong community isn't built on everyone thinking alike - it's built on respecting our differences while sharing our love for the game. And if you're finding the current atmosphere overwhelming, it's okay to step back. Take a break from the community, focus on what you enjoy about the game, and return when you're ready. As that's still much healthier than trying to silence it or convert it into an echo chamber whose opinion mirrors your own.

Anyways, I hope this resonates with others. Apes together strong 🦍

**EDIT:** I'd like to clarify my only goal was to address the player respect (or lack there of) in the community. I am NOT trying to start some toxic positivity movement and strongly oppose that. I believe in voicing constructive criticism, and even appreciate venting their positive/negative feelings as long as it remains focused _on the game_ instead of attacking other players. And preferably, is done respectfully 🙂",1978,308,1746071719.0,WutheringWaves,that_90s_guy,0.91,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1kbzp7a/you_like_it_i_dont_we_can_both_be_right_and_thats/

reddit_search_1cyj3lw,Not a great first impression,"Like most of y'all I have been waiting for this game for some time. I purposefully stayed in the dark until about a week ago to keep myself from overhyping. But still, after about 3 hours of playtime, this is not a good start. If Kuro has a QA department, they fell asleep. Just in my brief time I encountered...

* ""Full Screen"" window defaults to 1680x1050 despite my monitors being 1920x1080p.
* No Borderless Full Screen option
* 60fps cap (others have said the game was going to release at 120fps)
* Horrible pop-in on details during cutscenes
* Sleep inducing performances from the English VAs
* Poor audio mixing resulting in a loud hiss every time Yangyang says an ""S""
* Audio lines cutting off early
* Audio lines fading in so you miss the first few words.
* Very obvious British actors doing American accents
* Chinese words being pronounced multiple different ways, sometimes by the same character
* Audio referring to my female Rover as ""him""
* Field dialogues tripping over one another
* Field dialogues repeating multiple times for no reason
* Subtitles displaying the incorrect words
* Subtitles running off the screen with no way to scroll and see the rest.

Now let's talk about this opening story. The game is based around this awesome combat system that felt amazing to play. Too bad you only get to do a handful of fights before the story holds you down with endless dialogue about the Magistrate and her cryptic little clues. I feel like I've spent the majority of my 3 hour playtime having characters talk at me instead of fighting cool monsters.

And what they're saying is barely coherent. What is it with gacha games nowadays trying to have the most convoluted jargon-heavy worldbuilding? We've got The Lament, Waveworn Phenomenon, Tacet Fields, Tacet Discords and TD Outbreaks, Retroact Rain, Tacetite, Resonaters, Reverberations, Echos, Pangu Terminals, Sentinels, some vaccine candy and an outbreak from decades ago... look if you understand this stuff then that's great, but I have a headache. Good writing introduces concepts when they're relevant and doesn't flood the player with tons of expositional jargon to seem deep.

I want to like WW. The combat, what little I experienced, was super fun. Most of the characters seem really appealing and interesting. I really want another Genshin to sink my teeth into... but Kuro has got to do a lot better. I'll continue to play into the long weekend and hopefully some of the above issues will be fixed or go away. I'm playing with JP audio now which fixes the horrible VAs (even if they were bad I can't tell because I don't speak Japanese) but now whenever the subtitles decide to scroll off the screen I just lose out on whatever was being said. Fix your shit, Kuro!

EDIT: Wow, I honestly expected to wake up to either a bunch of people telling me to shut up and enjoy the game, or the mods taking this post down for some vague reason. I'm glad they're letting people vent their frustrations. I've gotten something close to 180 replies in my inbox and they're coming in by the minute, so I can't reply to everyone. Instead I wanna address a few common things I'm seeing.

**""The game runs fine for me, I don't have these issues you're having.""**

Any time a game launches with issues, there's always people who jump into the conversation to shout about how they're not having any problems and the game is perfect. Awesome. I'm so happy for you. But this isn't about you, so please move along. Go enjoy the game while we vent our frustrations and potentially get Kuro to fix the game into a state where we can also enjoy it. Also, criticism of the game does not equal hatred of the game. I want to love this game, I want to dump hundreds of hours (and possibly USD) into it, but I can't at this stage.

**""It's only 1.0! Be patient, Kuro always fixes stuff!""**

It's sad that this has become the state of gaming, where releasing an unoptimized, unfinished product can elicit some weird praise for how it will 'eventually' be a fully functioning game. Sorry, I'm old. I remember when 1.0 meant the game was ready to go and issues would be minimal. I also have faith that Kuro will fix the issues. It's in their best interest to do so. But these issues shouldn't have existed in the first place. And if we don't highlight them, Kuro won't know what to fix.

**""Genshin 1.0 was way worse!""**

\*sigh\* Do we really have to do this? Look, I'm a Day 1 Genshin player. My UID is 600019169. I was there from the moment the game launched. While it was nearly four years ago, I do remember some of the issues it had. There were some voice line hiccups and a few instances of the Traveler's gender being swapped in the dialogue. But that's it, as far as I recall. Nearly every line in Wuthering Waves has some kind of issue. And that only touches on a single aspect of the criticism. Yes, Genshin was not as polished as it is now, and four years from now Wuthering Waves will likely be just as polished, but that's not the point. Kuro released it's game four years later. They had their entire development cycle to ensure they would be better than Genshin Impact at launch. And they have failed miserably. Now, can we stop this childish comparing of two games 4 years apart? All it does it side-track the conversation.

EDIT 2: Kuro has released a statement addressing the criticisms and has not only apologized, but has vowed to fix them. Like I said before, I had no doubt they would fix their game, it's in their best interest, but having such a quick public response is really nice to see. I got what I wanted from Kuro: an apology and acknowledgement that this game needs to be fixed. 

And to everyone who ignored my request and continued to come in here and boast about how they don't have any issues, it's a perfect game and I'm just a Genshin/Hoyo shill... your welcome for the free 10 pulls. Making valid criticisms known only helps the game become better. Ignoring issues because you really like the game helps nobody.

reddit_search_1hp2jvu,2.0 I’m no longer worried about the future of the game and its direction. ," The game is ambitious, and the CEO of Kuro Games shares the same goals as his employees.  

We must honestly congratulate them for all the efforts they've made, both the good and the bad  (sometimes some changes weren’t necessary but well that's in the past, lol).  

All our constructive criticism for improving the game we love has paid off. A better relationship between players and developers has been established, along with the trust that comes with it.  

Whether it's the story mode, which some criticized rightly (and sometimes exaggeratedly  the "" gathering wife"" nickname still that funny).

The future endgame modes that will be significantly improved, they are really working on it. The coop mode is another area they are focusing on. In fact, during the live stream, we saw a very interesting event boss. I hope there will be even more endgame coop content because I can’t stress this enough: the hologram coop mode was the peak. I’ve never had so much fun or laughed so much.  

The exploration with the flight gadgets is really amazing, not to mention that they might be usable in other regions. In some interviews, it’s not clear if this will be exclusive to Renascita, so we’ll have to wait and see, but that’s to be taken with a grain of salt.  

Let’s not forget the most important thing the very identity of the game Wuthering Waves its is combat system which has no equivalent in the open-world gacha genre. It’s no surprise coming from the creators of PGR the masters of gameplay excellence.  

They’re planning to further improve the gameplay  and that promises to be incredible guys.  

Really, 2.0 truly deserves its name: renaissance ( Renascita)

They even said they want to be the best open-world gacha game. That’s ambition, and it makes me happy .  

So, are you still worried? Have these various interviews reassured you about the future of the game? I look forward to hearing from you.  

Finally, I want to tip my hat to the journalists who asked some really great questions.

reddit_search_1j207ml,"PSA: Brant was NOT ""Nerfed"" (by Selkey)","**Please upvote this, because it's an important matter, that affects the public perception of both the character Brant as well as Kuro Games. Please help me stop this misinformation.**

Hello, my name is [Selkey](https://www.youtube.com/@SelkeyYT) and I make high level guides and quickswap showcases and general WuWa content.

**By definition, a nerf is an intended weakening of a character in a game.** This cannot be considered a nerf by definition, as there is no notice of this change being ""intended"", thus it can be concluded, that it is an unintended bug, that will be fixed.

# Video Version:

[PSA: Brant was NOT ""Nerfed"" (2:19)](https://youtu.be/hSLiopoqn6U)

I highly recommend watching the video version, to have a better idea of the visual proof, which is important for the conclusion. It's just 2 minutes anyway.

# Intro:

I wanted to make a short post/video to reassure everyone, that Brant is fine. Please, pull him and do not let anyone tell you, that he is now ""unplayable"" or ""the next Calcharo"".

For anyone that is not informed, Brant recently had an undocumented change on the live version of the game, which enables him to dodge counter mid air. **This change SLIGHTLY decreases his damage output.**

[The post that started it all.](https://preview.redd.it/0eqxpgb7wbme1.png?width=1379&format=png&auto=webp&s=c59081ad77247fff904cfe00f3691196d20600a5)

I want to make it very clear, **that I am 99% sure that this is a bug.** You can be almost certain, that Brant will be released without being able to use his Dodge Counter mid air. **There is no patch note, that documents this ""change"" on the live version of the game, so it is most likely an unintended side effect of their coding.**

# Why I strongly believe it is a bug:

[This is not it.](https://preview.redd.it/0etm2gvkwbme1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f8666293a49d8bdba007f85b9a63855c47ed654)

**Many people believe that this is an intended mechanic, but it isn't.**

**Here is the proof (credit to** u/Blanooman):

[Blanooman, MY GOAT \(everyone send him love in DMs\)](https://reddit.com/link/1j207ml/video/9z25so4twbme1/player)

In this clip we can clearly see that Brant is not only doing Dodge Counter after the first two stages of his Mid-air attacks, but also after Stage 3 AND 4.

**This is not intended. It's a bug.**

# What if it isn't a bug:

Even if the 1% chance does apply here and he will be shipped with this change, **do not worry, Brant is still fine.**

Let me explain:

1. Many boss attacks do not require a dodge input to be avoided by Brant. The impact of this change has been largely exaggerated because of the Lorelei boss specifically.
2. This change doesnt affect quickswap players at all, because you are invincible during swaps.
3. Even if you don't swap, the effect of this change is already very small and Brant can use multiple workarounds, to minimize the effect of this change even further. These workarounds are as simple as dodging twice or waiting, so they are casual friendly and easy.
4. These workarounds are not even necessary. If you just do the Dodge Counter, get grounded and press Skill, you lose a negligible amount of damage, a small amount of Forte gain and gain a small amount of Concerto instead. **This is the most overblown issue of all time.**

I will not talk much about the workarounds, that will probably not find any use anyway, [but here is a post by Blanooman](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1j0vojf/extended_brant_gameplay_with_the_new_midair_dodge/), who has greatly helped me with collecting information for this post/video. He explains in his post the workarounds in further detail, for anyone that is interested.

# Conclusion:

This change makes no sense at all and there are hundreds of better ways to nerf Brant, if that is what they wanted to do. The main consequence of this change, is that it makes his gameplay unnecessarily inconvenient. Nothing else.

Anyone that tells you that this makes him ""unplayable"", ""weak"", or ""basically Calcharo"". You are factually wrong. Losing 1-2% of damage in the worst case scenario, is not going to kill a character. 

**Because of the complete pointlessness of this change and the change happening mid live patch, we can conclude, that this is NOT an intended change. It is a bug.**

# My message to other content creators and the community:

The misinformation, that has been going around about this change is beyond disappointing to me. I have spent **a solid 8 hours** factchecking all the information I provided in this video/post. I strongly believe that the community deserves content creators, that value the time of their audience and provide them with correct information, which was carefully researched and confirmed true.

**I hope that everyone who was involved in spreading this misinformation, can learn from this situation and move forward providing a better service to the community. Content creators and consumers alike.**

*At the very least we made ABSOLUTELY SURE, that Kuro MORE than knows about this. (they know, trust me they know)*

# It is VERY important to me, that no harassment or harm will be sent to anyone that was involved in this. Please respect content creators, Kuro Games and their well being.

# I only wish to stop this misinformation from spreading.

[Lorelei is \\""misinformation\\"", Brant is me.](https://preview.redd.it/b8h1pta90cme1.png?width=1926&format=png&auto=webp&s=814c95496f77d39cf3d84f61cca478a3b9c84451)

I never heard of Kuro games before but I do know that they released PGR which I only heard positive feedback from especially how Kuro games listens to players.

But what concerns me the most is how generous Kuro games is? Can F2p players hold ground with upcoming new characters? How about anniversary/new year rewards?

reddit_search_1dcq1hj,Echoes Farming Doesn't Have to Take Near Infinite Amount of Time,"**Preface**  
Currently the chance to get a desired (just sub-stats) piece of echo assuming we have a base of desired main stat with the highest roll is **1 in 158146560 (1 in 158 million)**. There are 13 sub-stat pool with an echo can get 5 stat where each stat (according to [Sweetily](https://youtu.be/-pASPObq5hw?si=mVJaxLc0KpwwnpQE&t=359)) can roll to either low, mid-low, mid-high, high it brings us to:  
1/13 \* 1/12 \* 1/11 \* 1/10 \* 1/9 \* (1/4)\^5 (assuming even probability distribution among the sub-stats and rolls).

With our current rate for tuner and echo exp, this will probably not be finished even in 10 years.

**Why having a deterministic progression with clear timetable is perfectly fine?**

Let's start by taking a look at Arknights & Reverse 1999 (these are two other gacha games I know that doesn't have near infinite amout of time grinding to max a character despite being a PVE only games and low-end investment can clear most if not all of contents)

**Arknights**

For Arknights using planner from [gamepress.gg](https://gamepress.gg/arknights/tools/arknights-operator-planner) to exhaust all character upgrade options for a completely new player requires approximately 44586 energy

[Required energy to maximize a character in Arknights](https://preview.redd.it/etbbaomvqr5d1.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=b61106182573cf674b56054791b68cd29c93d3f3)

1 sanity is recovered for every 6 minutes bringing the total to \~6 months. This is without materials from the events and passive currency income that provided by the game, in reality this is closer to \~3-4 months **for a completely fresh new player with 0 resources** (tbh when I'm still a novice in AK it felt more closer to 2 months), for veterans who plays daily, they are already accumulated a lot of resources that raising a character to max is just a matter of clicking to spend the resources and waiting for about 2-3 days because training room has cooldown.

Edit:  
Adding this for how grateful AK players are. With some comments on how not having RNG stats in the game made them stays.

[Can we take a moment to appreciate Arknight's lack of RNG stats?](https://www.reddit.com/r/arknights/comments/1dd31tn/can_we_take_a_moment_to_appreciate_arknights_lack/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**Reverse 1999**

For Reverse 1999 using planner from [kornblume](https://windbow27.github.io/kornblume/planner) to exhaust all character upgrade options for a completely new player requires approximately 17343 energy

[Required energy to maximize a character in Reverse 1999](https://preview.redd.it/8ri37eytrr5d1.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4239f3f7f36982324cad83101adc5cca560eb75)

72 days' worth of energy. This is without materials from the events and passive currency income that provided by the game, in reality this is closer to \~50-60 days. Same as Arknights Veterans will have a much easier time and will take much shorter time to raise a character.

Again, for a completely **new** player.

**In both of these games a perfectly built is a luxury and IT'S NOT REQUIRED AT ALL, players can get away with 60-70% of character progression to clear all content to the most difficult one, also both are PVE only games. Despite that both of these games still open the opportunity to maximize their character. Because it has its own part of satisfaction which makes the players gets more attached to the game.**

The point here is that every character in these 2 games can be maxed out within a reasonable amount of time despite the nature of the game.

And **every day IS a tangible** progression towards the goal.

Now, what can Kuro do to refine their echo system?

**Fusion**

First, they can create a new feature that let player combine 10 of the same echoes to one and allowing them to choose what main stat they want.

[10 to 1 fusion with main option to choose main stat.](https://preview.redd.it/0t99yozesr5d1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ce9a696d32118aef69f3982410d7a0cae42618c)

**Craft able Special Tuner**

Lastly Kuro can add new feature that let player to craft a Special Tuner that will guarantee a sub-stat with the highest roll possible by spending **their waveplates.**

[Craft able Tuner with choosen sub-stat](https://preview.redd.it/l1ehigavsr5d1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a73430e8ebbcab0391de0eace61af137f359adf)

This is where Kuro can fine tune the amount of wave plates that player needs to spend to craft **25 Special Tuners** for **5 pieces of echoes**.

We know in wuthering waves each echo can be moved to other character in The Tower of Adversity, if this is a concern for Kuro, they can disallow this option.

For the duration Kuro can align it with the timing of new character releases making pulling character much more excited because they don't need to spend years of farming just to see their fullest potential (outside of sequence).

They could start with ~~3-5 months'~~ \~2 months' (since we also need waveplates to level up weapons and skills and resonator's level) worth of **RAW waveplates for 25 Special Tuners**, but materials from events will help this which will make crafting it much faster. At the end Veterans who are loyal to the game will have a much better time being able to craft the special tuner right away by using resources they accumulated daily.

This is also can open the path for not so optimal build that players can comes up because it will not take years of farming to achieve.

**The Main Point**

Having a tangible deterministic progression system that will increase every time a player login and spend resources in the game that they can see and confirm is miles better than a completely RNG progression system.

**But infinite or near impossible perfect echoes is to incentivize whale to spend!**

All I can say is that if Arknights and Reverse 1999 can do it why not WuWa, besides I knew **a lot** of spenders in other gacha games got tired of refreshing and eventually not spending on any new characters which leading to quit **with the near infinite/impossible farming system**.

I'm hopeful for changes, while the game is still new, and dev are listening to feedback we can push Kuro to just remove the RNG in the stats or add additional tangible progression to echo system.

**TLDR;**

Tangible deterministic progression system that player can see and confirm is miles better than a completely RNG progression system (current echo system).

Solutions,

Feature to Combine 10 echoes of the same echo to 1 and give player ability to select the main stat.

Add new craft able Special Tuner by spending waveplates that will guarantee a selected sub-stat with highest roll that player can acquire by consuming ~~3-5 months'~~ \~2 months' worth of raw waveplates or less for 25 Special Tuners (which gets significantly better as the game giving out the mats through events and for future veterans that stay for 2+ years with abundant resources under their belt).

reddit_search_1d1d2ek,A Perspective Into How DISASTROUSLY WW Was Received in China that Prompted The Compensation,"Any sane person should at least admit that WW has had a disastrous launch. Even if your experience is fluid, it is not representative of tens of thousands of people having stuttering/lag issues (like me). Well, just how bad can it get? We all know that CN Genshin players are now mass exiting WW and returning to Genshin, basically turning the comment section of their official account into a confessional (currently sitting at an astonishing [54k](https://www.bilibili.com/opus/934207145588555810) comments. But what's the situation elsewhere? Oh we are in for a ride

A simple search of WW right now on Bilibili (Chinese Youtube) yields a dazzling amount of videos pointing out various problems with almost every aspect of WW. Most of them are gaining hundreds of thousands even million of views. This is surprising since it's only been a few days after the initial launch. Without certain CCs acting as a filter for critical opinions, CN players are relentless in their dissing of the WW fiasco. I will divide these videos into several subcategories, pick a few of the most influential videos, present the stats, and talk about the gist of their ideas. You can check out the link and see the general sentiments of the CN players in the comments.

***PLEASE NOTE THAT PERSONALLY I DO NOT AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THEY SAY BELOW. IM MERELY REITERATING THEIR OPINIONS. THESE VIDEOS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT I THINK OF WW AND GENSHIN.

This type of videos mostly compares the two games from the overall experience down to the animation of climbing up the floors to express their disappointment in Kuro's lack of attention to details and reevaluates their view on Genshin. ""The meaning of your journey"" refers to what Dainsleif said in the Travail trailer and what Venti said at the end of Mond archon quest. For example:

# 2. Critiquing the subpar plot of WW

And I don't just mean the beginning. CN players do not like ANY of the plot, spanning the entirety of the main story and Jiyan story quest. One of the major things they were discontent with was how Jiyan and Geshu Lin were depicted in the main story and Battle underneath the Crescent cinematics. In their eyes, Jiyan fled the battlefield when his superior Geshu Lin issued the command to stay in the frontline, and he is thereby called the ""Deserter General"" (And some used Jing Yuan's ultimate line to make fun of Jiyan, saying ""Time for the master desertation!"" Funniest shit I've ever read) [There were actually already a significant portion of players who were dissatisfied with the plot under the official cinematics before the launch.](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ri421D7Xd) This is a screenshot of Chinese players spamming ""?"" on the official cinematics.

https://preview.redd.it/xubn9n9hyu2d1.png?width=2570&format=png&auto=webp&s=176a23e80bc59b971ca8249124faa7b7b95ecfc1

Later, Jiyan put the military's commands in rover's hands as if rover were not an amnestic being but somehow an experienced combat general, prompting the community to doubt Jiyan's military prowess and decisions.

Another one is how Jianxin treats the group of people who destroyed military radar. People are expecting her and Yangyang (who is associated with the military) to bring them to justice, while they just let criminals walk free. I could list more, like Lingyang's story, Scar, etc., but you get the idea. Here are a few:

# 3. Streamers Losing their shit Playing WW

A lot of streamers who play the game (outside sponsored streamers of course) were so extremely disappointed that they just broke down going through WW.

5. Analyzing the revenue WW is making

WW's launch only placed it at around 10th place max on the revenue ranking chart for the mobile apps in China while constantly dropping, which is painfully mediocre as even ToF's launch placed it at around 3-4th for a few days, not to mention that game like Star Rail occupied the top place for 3-4 days straight during launch.

[Even worse than GFL 2? WW revenue day1! Kuro immediately gave out 10 pull compensation!](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18T421S7Lw) (178k View)

It should be noted that I only picked a few, but there are plenty other videos at around 400k - 900k up to 1M views criticizing every aspect of the game. ( And they are constantly increasing in views. Just go to the vids and check the differences between the one I documented and their current state. The views are going up so fast)

Even after they gave out a free standard 5 star selector, they are still getting roasted relentlessly in their comment section at this very moment, demanding them to switch up their writers and optimize stuttering. [The newest one](https://t.bilibili.com/935815108288839731?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0) has 17k comments already. Ironically, the common sentiment is that ""Kuro didn't listen"" and that they are playing dead.

[\(IDK how tf google translated PGR to HI3, but it should be PGR instead of HI3 in the original comment\)](https://preview.redd.it/z90o5qvtju2d1.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=f62f2daded816776c4c1c943656cf2441aefc4e4)

Funnily enough, there are already rumors that Kuro has changed some in-game lines and designs based on CN player's feedback. For example, a line that Yangyang said that was deemed disrespectful towards soldiers is removed. And it seems that Scar's design is altered because CN players are sick of his cock-zipper for some reason.

reddit_search_1i9pubv,What a wake up call this was,"So I've been playing Gathering Wives very casually since launch, sometimes I don't even log in. I have bad luck with echoes so when I do log in I'm farming them (without success). Pretty much all my characters have lvl 6 skills and good echoes, but I do have some nice ones. 

Anyway, I decided to try this thing for the Astrite (gotta put in the work for Zani) and boy oh boy, to say I was humbled is an understatement. I felt like I was back in Monster Hunter back when Leshen, Behemoth or Alatreon dropped (gunlance ftw). Underleveled weapons, characters, skills and somewhat decent echoes. I think I wasn't giving WuWa the respect it deserved and underestimated the game while overestimating my skills lol. ""Gacha games are easy, no need to build these characters for now. I'll do it some day"", well apparently that day came.

Putting in the time to build my Yinlin and learning Fallacy of No Return's moveset (this thing hits like truck-kun on the first episode of a dodgy isekai anime) made it SO satisfying when I did defeat it. Moments like these are what gaming is all about.

reddit_search_1cylmdp,A Troubling Pattern I’ve Noticed About Kuro. ,"After playing the game for about 3 hrs I want to bring up something I’ve noticed about Kuro but didn’t want to say before I played this game. I was honestly very optimistic and excited for this, a bit wary after the livestream. 

Unfortunately what I’ve gotten so far is a boring story with a badly directed dub, missing subtitles, with some decent combat and visuals when they don’t bug. For example when talking to the children at the City Hall their faces were gone. Just gone, some of the creepiest stuff I’ve seen.

I take the approach that there is no problem with taking inspiration from something and then adapting it into something new and original. Hell I love Genshin and they themselves admitted how much Breath of the Wild inspired them. 

It is no surprise that Wuthering Waves takes inspiration from Genshin Impact, and I had no problem with that. However, there needs to be substance there and from what I’ve gotten so far WW is mostly style with little substance. The trailers look good, the combat looks good, and the world at least from a glance looks good.

However, the game isn’t optimized well, there are very distracting issues like missing text, and the focus on anything but the combat is missing. I tried out PGR a while back and felt the same way: a meandering story that was a lot of word vomit with little getting to know the characters, all in exchange for cool combat. 

But I’m sorry, combat alone does not an open world game make. It needs good world building and investment to thrive. I’m not feeling the same passion from the developers that I got off of Genshin. 

I really want to see Kuro succeed through innovation but all we’ve gotten is similarities to Hoyoverse and with the exception of combat, done worse.

The troubling pattern I’ve seen is that Kuro takes a Hoyoverse game, puts their spin on it but it turns out like a cake of all icing. Pretty on the outside, but hard to stomach for a while.

Timeline:
2014 - Gun Girls Z (Hoyo 2D chibi fighting side scroller)
2016 - Twin Tails Battleground (Kuro 2D chibi fighting side scroller)
2016 - Honkai Impact 3rd (Hoyo 3D Action RPG with stage based content)
2019 - PGR (Kuro 3D Action RPG with stage based content)
2020 - Genshin (Hoyo Open World RPG)
2024 - WuWa (Kuro Open World RPG)

A pattern of just following what is popular and trying to ride a hype train emerges and that isn’t cool. I want to see Kuro innovate and not constantly be riding the coattails of another company saying, hey we can do it but “better” to varying levels of success. I hope that they can differentiate themselves with WuWa in the coming weeks but first they need to put the icing on the f****** cake and not on icing.",1558,667,1716443513.0,WutheringWaves,doritoperson,0.86,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cylmdp/a_troubling_pattern_ive_noticed_about_kuro/

reddit_search_1dv3f23,I think Kuro is cooking something with 2nd Reawakening,"So for those that don't know, 2nd reawakening is a recent concept introduced in Wuthering Waves where characters can awaken additional powers for a 2nd time should they manage to survive through overclocking (there are probably more conditions introduced in the future). 

In gacha games, it is a common thing to introduce alternate versions of units (same units but are probably more powerful or has different mechanics to the original). This is done to reignite the hype for the character especially to fan favorites (most recent and most popular is Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae from Hsr).

I believe that Kuro will try to utilize 2nd reawakening to create alternate versions of characters or even promote 4 stars to 5 stars. I believe that the Jinhsi we are playing is the post-2nd reawakening version of her since before that, when she manifests scales in her body its painful but when we play her and she manifests literal horns she does not show signs of pain? 

If utilized correctly, Kuro might just give us the best reason for alternate characters since it  is already implied thay 2nd reawakening will be an important plot point in the future (they might even give it out to current 4 stars like candy, as seen with PGR). I even think that our first 2nd reawakening will be from the Fractsidus.

reddit_search_1k3caks,There are people in this subreddit treating as if the majority of members in this subreddit is not aware that Kuro Games is a game developer company that chose to develop a game with gacha mechanics and therefore it made them greedy.,"I saw some comments under posts talking about how this is expected from a game developer that chose to develop a gacha game and people should not expect them to become their friends. Since when ? Nobody in this subreddit has ever treated the game developer as our friend and defended its attempted predatory practices. Actually, i would go so far to say that this is not what a good friend is supposed to be. There is a reason why wuthering waves has cultivated such a loyal fanbase from ex-genshin and pgr players, they care about the game and our wellbeing. For those people who are saying that this is just the average gacha game developers theatrics, let me tell you how this mindset is preventing a gacha game from becoming so much more. Remember last time there was a survey about whether the weapons should be exclusive to the character or not, they asked us whether we want it or not and they agreed. Also, a majority of players who joined in and played wuthering waves is so that there is competition and set an example in the gacha space.  Kuro Games is also DIFFERENT in their approach towards development of their gacha game by making game first and gacha second although this is quite taken too literally. This anniversary rewards is a massive BETRAYAL of its principles. We are not going to let this slide like how every mistake they have made.

reddit_search_1ifm27n,"I just pulled my very first limited 5*, and now im screwed...","...because I actually have to play seriously

Up until now, I was just logging in to claim free pulls without really playing. I checked my mail and saw they had given me 1,600 Astrite for some reason (plus the shop reset), so I figured, why not? I wasn’t expecting much since my pity was low, but then… the 5-star animation appeared. I was genuinely surprised—and thrilled.

I’ve always been a fan of Jinhsi. Her animations have always looked incredible to me, I love her combat style and design, and pulling for her had been a goal of mine from the start—but I never thought I’d actually get her

I originally downloaded the game on mobile, but after losing my 50/50, I dropped it. Now that I can play on PS5, where it runs much better, I decided to give it another shot. And that’s what scares me—because now I actually can enjoy the game properly, which means I have no excuse not to take it seriously.

The real issue? I already play Wuthering Waves, Genshin Impact, and Honkai. Trying to balance all three is definitely a terrible idea… but who cares? I’ve decided to not decide and just spread my time across all of them as evenly as possible.

So yeah, I got her, and thanks to her, I’m officially in for the long run.

That said, since I’m still low adventure level and new to the actual gameplay, I’d love some advice. I enjoy clearing content efficiently and playing as hardcore as possible, so what should my next steps be? Who should I aim for in future banners? What’s the current meta looking like? 

Also, if any experienced players have general advice for a newbie like me, I'd love to hear it - just to get a better sense of where to go from here.

reddit_search_1bp81o0,"If kuro thinks the game is ready, then it most likely is ready","Since you can now pre regester for download on IOS and play store,  the game is looking more likely to be released by the end of May, the time is coming when we can all jump into the game and enjoy what kuro has prepared for us. 

People who are worried about the games release date should not forget that in the latest development notes, kuro has outlined specific fixes that they are implementing into the game,  this includes 1- specific combat and movement tweaking 2- echo system tweaking 3- story optimization and fixes 4- localization quality control, and many more specific changes, the core game is ready and good to go,  these fixes and tweaking is to make the game even better for the players.

Another thing that people worried about is the end game,  and the game has in it's base release many activities that you can partake in after you have completed the story, the end game in wuthering waves is actually divided into different levels:

1- depth of elusive realms ,  this is an end game that is designed to have easy access,  but becomes more challenging the deeper you get into it,  if you played cursed waves in PGR,  then you will have an idea about how it works,  not to mention that new challenges and side stories will be added with every couple of patches.

2- hologram bosses,  these are the skill oriented end game challenges,  not to mention that with every patch that comes with new bosses,  we will be getting different bosses with different mechanics,  I think the most difficult holograms are yet to be released. 

3- tower of adversity,  this is the more stat check end game,  as the timer is tight and team building and cleaning strategies will be the focus, but skill will still play an important role,  as dodging and countering is one of the core gameplay mechanics. Also this game mode will evolve as the game progresses.

4- echo farming,  you will always want to go into the open world to farm resources and echoes,  not to mention looking for elusive echoes,  as someone who loves arpgs, this will be my personal favorite activities. 

&#x200B;

I personally can't wait,  and when the game is out it will be my main gacha game ""together with PGR "", this is a journey, and it is a journey with a developer that has showed us that they listen,  the game is looking great,  and I am hopeful that greater things are yet to come, the wait is almost rover !!",57,70,1711561566.0,WutheringWaves,Kitchen-Air-1012,0.65,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1bp81o0/if_kuro_thinks_the_game_is_ready_then_it_most/

reddit_search_1gnuvlt,Gacha circle stagnation and CN revenue decline in 2024 for discussion and archive purposes.,"**Date: November 10th  2024.**

This post is not meant to doom any game but for informational purposes only.

**The current top 3 CN gaming companies by revenue(2023) is as follows (in US$ billions):**

1.Tencent(overall/gaming):(86/25 $bn)

2.Netease(overall/gaming):(14/11.5 $bn)

3. Mihoyo: 5 $bn (estimated)

\* Mihoyo revenue is estimated to be 4-6 $bn

**\[Gacha circle/playerbase\]:** People interested in gachagames. The Gacha circle is part of a much bigger ACG(Anime, comics, games) circle.

# Gacha circle stagnation:

**The rate of expansion/decline (or) stagnation is not enough to accommodate several upcoming or existing games. The newer games suffer from a low player base and bad retention rates.**

* Companies need to fight for player's time and money. (OR) they need to break the circle just like genshin did.
* GLOBAL might be in a slow expansion state due to the presence of low/middle-income countries. But revenue might have reached an upper bound.
* The CN player base largely acknowledges the decline of the circle particularly in the latter half of the year.
* No gacha game released this year (P5X, Wuthering Waves, ZZZ, Guilongchao, etc) has met market expectations.
* CN has entered a gacha winter where newer games are immediately put into ICU.
* You either hunker down to survive the winter, or you search for a tiny spark of hope in GLOBAL, which may not even exist.

# CN revenue decline in the same year:

**From this point onwards, you should forget the numbers and observe the decline.**

We will take a look at two very similar banners from Genshin Impact this year. The Revenue source is [gacharevenue.com](http://gacharevenue.com) (**an Android multiplier of 1.75 is used since we can't observe CN Android chart data**)

Any gacha banner makes the most money in the first 7 days.

1. Raiden Shogun(4th appearance) and Yoimiya(5th appearance) from \[Jan 10th 2024 -Jan 31st 2024\]
2. Kinich(1st appearance) and Raiden shogun(5th appearance) from \[Sep 18th 2024 - Oct 9th 2024\]

* Yoimiya Raiden banner revenue = 63M (top 3 in ios charts, blocked by TikTok but passed Tencent video)
* Kinich Raiden banner revenue = 19M (top 9 in ios charts, blocked by IQIYI but passed Netease music)

**The data indicates that despite the introduction of an Archon/new character banner, there has been a decline of approximately 70%.**

Unless people started throwing away their iPhones in 8 months, This is a very unnatural decline.

**This is an extreme case, but based on my observations, there's a revenue decline of approximately 40-50% compared to the previous year, particularly in the latter half. For October 2024, Xilonen's revenue shows a drop of about 40-50% when compared to Wriothesely's in October 2023. The estimated revenue for Xilonen is \~300 million yuan, while Wriothesely's revenue is 738 million yuan.**

# CN revenue decline explained through year-over-year comparison:

All the data here comes from the Bilibili uploader **国产二次元手游观察** (Observation on domestic 2D mobile games). His channel link: [space.bilibili.com/179948458](http://space.bilibili.com/179948458)

His total estimated revenue for Tower of Fantasy is pretty close to the official revenue report this year(only a 10% error). He has been estimating revenue since 2019 and supposedly works at some game company. Usually uploads around the 15th day of the month (**the reason October data is missing**). He obtains this data from the sensor tower but applies his methods for accurate estimation.

**PC revenue is not included. But if you are curious the uploader uses a multiplier ranging from 0.9 to 1.1 for Genshin, Wuwa. In a recent interview, a Tencent executive confirmed that for at least CN, mobile and PC revenue are equal.(1:1)**

**The currency used here is CNY. \[1 unit = 1 million yuan\] (Example**: **20 = 20 million yuan)**

***Wait!!! why does this data not correlate to gacha revenue charts even after currency conversion?***

*This is merely an assumption, but it appears the uploader has not factored in the 30% Apple tax(IAP revenue) for mobile transactions in his data. Rumors suggest that miHoYo might have received a special discount from Apple on this tax, and it's likely Android offers a similar concession. This would logically explain why the PC ratio is 1:1, as PCs are not subject to the Apple tax. We do not know the exact value of this discount.*

*The proper procedure to convert to USD(Example):*

*CN JAN 2024 GENSHIN BANNER (Raiden/Yoimiya): 564 million yuan*

1. *Divide by 7 for conversion into USD (564/7 = 80.57) \[1 USD \~ 7 CNY\]*
2. *Divide by 2.5 to get iOS revenue\[Uploader uses 1.5 Android multiplier\] (80.57/2.5 = 32.228)*
3. *Multiply with 0.7 to take away Apple tax (32.228\*0.7 =  22.5596)*
4. *Multiply with 2.75 (our chart's Android multiplier is 1.75) (22.55\*2.75 = 62.0389)*
5. *62 million USD is close to our chart data of 63 million USD.*

***TLDR: For Genshin multiply with 0.11. For HSR multiply with 0.0982 to get chart data.***

***Discrepancies may persist since our charts are updated on the first day of each month. Accurate data from Sensor Tower typically requires at least a 10-day waiting period for retrieval.***

**As I analyze the data, I will compare the total revenue across similar periods and calculate the overall percentage decrease.**

**Generally speaking,**

* **<=-10%: Can be considered a rounding** **error or natural decline, No need to worry**
* **-11 to -20%:Also in the natural decline range but there might be some signs of decline.**
* **-20%to -30%: The Game is in a slow/medium decline state. Early Warning signs for unnatural decline.**
* **>-30%: Unnatural decline that cannot be explained by one reason alone.**
* **=-50%: Revenue is halved.**



We will observe 4 different games Genshin, HSR, Arknights, and Reverse 1999.

**\[Genshin Impact**\]: Released September 28th 2020. Comparing 2023-2024 monthly revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/7rbrcwvxj00e1.jpg?width=491&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9227e6335e69915707b434f0cdf57f2617ab8b65

* **From the period \[Jan-Sept\] the decline is -53.1%. An unnaturally high decline. Even comparing the period after the HSR launch \[May-Sept} the decline is -59%.**
* **I heard a rumor in CN that the year-over-year decline of genshin across all platforms is around 50-60% which is in line with this data.**
* Dehya likely generated more revenue than any character from Natlan. Dehya's debut ranked in the top 2 (though blocked by TikTok), with her lowest point at 23, while Xilonen debuted in the top 5 (blocked by Tencent Video), with her lowest point around 65.
* People back then used to pull characters out of pure love, not meta.

**\[Honkai Star Rail\]**: Released April 26th, 2023. Comparing 2023 - 2024 monthly revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/oi9w3372k00e1.jpg?width=490&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5fe3897ad5d6c877effa5a326a1b90ac9ed7c96

* **Period \[Apr-Sept\] the decline is -51.7%. Again an unnaturally high decline. Excluding launch months, April and May the decline from period \[June-Sept\] is -54.7%.**
* I could not accept this result so I tried making 2.0 coincide with 1.0

**\[Shifted Honkai star rail\]**: I shifted the months of 2024 by two positions, so January becomes March. 2.0 coincides with 1.0. Let's take a look.

https://preview.redd.it/mpzbwmgbk00e1.jpg?width=489&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=423b1f49f9d0863471927761c2a00ab10d5411a1

* **I anticipated the decline to be less than -20% after shifting, but when comparing revenue from April to November, the decline is actually -36.9%, which is still above 30%. Excluding the launch months of April and May, the decline from June to November is -41.9%.**
* I've tried everything to make it look good. I give up.

**\[Arknights\]**: Released 1st May 2019. Comparing 2023 - 2024 revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/xcksu1acq00e1.jpg?width=522&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef2d48aa90c3f2b496de23d5e880eafe7c98347f

* **From \[Jan-Sept\], the decline of -12.5% is very low and could almost be regarded as a natural decline.**
* **Market conditions and movements have little impact on Arknights and its player base in China.**
* **I had anticipated a decline of around 20%, but the actual decrease for a game that's five years old has exceeded my expectations.**
* **I've heard that CN Arknights boasts impressive retention rates, and from what I've seen, this seems to be accurate.**
* **There might be an Arknights route where stability is given preference over expansion.**



**\[Reverse 1999\]: I thought R1999 was launched in February 2023. However, as I went through the videos from 2024 back to 2023, I discovered that the game was released on May 31st. Yes, it was just one day in May, making the comparison period quite small. The data looks quite bad.**

**Initially, I intended to cover both Azur Lane and HI3, but they are now seven years old. Moreover, Reverse 1999 is the only healthy game released in 2023 that is doing well this year.**

* 265% increase!!
* **Comparing revenue \[May-Sept\] the decline is -19% which is in line with my expectations but we need much more data.**
* The game is doing relatively well despite being affected by market conditions.

**\[ZZZ and WUWA\]:**

* Both were released at similar timeframes, they are notorious for having very low retention rates.
* Both are launched when the industry is already in decline. They both faced a nearly 80% decline after just 3 months
* Both are born male-oriented. They sell fanservice and spicy food which is not liked by female players. The gender ratio(Female/male characters) is probably fixed at 1:3. The female player base itself is very small when compared to Genshin.
* These two games have not been favorably received in numerous female gaming circles.
* Introducing more male characters to achieve a 50/50 gender ratio may not yield the desired outcome. It could potentially confuse the current male player base, possibly making them leave.
* As both are male-oriented, they will likely stabilize at some point next year.

# Some thoughts about decline:

* The current CN market condition is extremely polarizing with various gender conflicts.
* MiHoYo's global expansion may have provided some relief, but there's an approximate 15-20% decline in revenue for both of its games, which is not as steep as the 50% experienced in China.
* I am 100% sure HSR does not have the same level of player base decline as genshin did. It is much more stable. Did Market conditions and Genshin decline also affect HSR?
* HSR doesn't seem to have the same momentum as genshin did in its second year.
* Seems like Genshin 4th year = HSR 2nd year = ZZZ 1st year.
* 2nd half of this year(H2) has been brutal for many gacha games.
* Games with a dedicated core player base appear to be more stable.
* Mixed games will likely go the Arknights route of fixing the ratio at 1:3 and not expanding the circle.

# Strange events that further support the decline:

* The chairman of China's third-largest gaming company was compelled to take the stage, tearfully apologizing for the inability to distinguish between voices and claiming, ""We will return to our original intention(roots).""
* Every gacha developer looked up to mihoyo and their development process. His words will have wider implications for the entire industry.
* Kuro CEO strange words ""It's okay as long as we survive"".
* Arknights Endfield, which has not announced a release date, is appearing at various gaming global exhibitions.
* Perfect World(Studio Hotta, developer of Tower of Fantasy), which lacks global distribution experience, is attempting to launch NTE GLOBAL servers simultaneously. Tower of Fantasy Global is distributed by Tencent.
* **Genshin has introduced more quality-of-life improvements in 4 patches than it did in the entire 4 years of its service.**

# Final Evidence:

This is what prompted me to work on this post. Appmagic has a top-publishers page for every year 

Here: [Top Publishers — AppMagic](https://appmagic.rocks/top-charts/publishers?aggregation=year&date=2024-01-01)

In years 2021,2022,2023 Mihoyo(COGNOSPHERE) is firmly in 6th position. But this year it is in 11th position with only 1.5 months remaining. Highly unlikely to reach the 6th position. Appmagic tracks IAP revenue(includes Apple tax) and does not include Android CN revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/ik4cxboas00e1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=273db7ecea7bfdf8c66b58a1232f41accc975923

I don't know the exact numbers but there might be a decline of around 20% this year.

***Market leader declining year-over-year despite the release of a new game is a worrying sign for the industry.***

***In China, it's primarily the gacha games that are affected by this ""Winter."" Companies like Tencent and Netease, along with other casual game developers, are maintaining the same performance numbers as last year. Hearthstone, which was released recently, is performing well.***

  
I have been working on this post gradually over the past week(most of this is typed on mobile). In two days, I will publish the Global data. It is considerably more optimistic and somewhat boring as well.

For October data estimates from various sources are GEN\~300, HSR\~250, and ZZZ\~76.

reddit_search_1izthak,Launching Wuthering Waves on Epic Games Store has been broken *since launch*,"I've noticed that not many people talk about this anymore, even though it’s been confirmed to be a real issue. When will launching WuWa on Epic Games finally be fixed? Specifically, when launching the game via EGS, it sometimes shows as running in Task Manager, but the game itself doesn’t actually open.

There’s already a thread about this on Reddit that was posted — mind you — [nine months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cx5tc9/epic_games_version_of_the_wuwa_isnt_launching/). It’s honestly unacceptable that this still hasn’t been fixed after so long. Having to manually launch the game via *launcher.exe* from the game files is not something players should have to do.

I know this isn’t a problem for the mobile players, or for those who stick with the Kuro launcher, but I use EGS because I get rewards for in-game purchases (basically cashback), and I want to support the developers by spending here and there. But it’s really frustrating to deal with such a long-standing issue, and it makes supporting the game that much harder.

P.S. Yes, I’ve already reported this issue to the devs multiple times through the feedback form.",57,16,1740698265.0,WutheringWaves,frozendome,0.92,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1izthak/launching_wuthering_waves_on_epic_games_store_has/

reddit_search_1cyme0b,"Brief Wuthering Waves Review, Straight to the Point","Going to summarize various issues I have with the game.

Story: it’s by and far the worst aspect of the game. The devs saying they rewrote 90% of the story post cbt1 was a huge red flag in hindsight. It’s a cliche plot, but that’s generally a lot of gachas. What kills the story is the delivery. It’s ass to the max. You’re thrown fictional jargon on every new line, and they basically never bring it up again, so you’re just wondering what the point of introducing so much pointless terminology was. And for the other terminology that is actually lore-relevant, there’s just so much of it, sometimes 3-4 random terms you can barely remember thrown in a single textbox that you’re immediately turned off. Please fix the story. 2/10

Exploration: the movements are janky. I know the exact people out there that were praising this game’s parkour and exploration to high heaven during cbt2, but we have to be honest. It’s janky, glitchy, and not always intuitive. You also pretty much press the run+forward button and you can cross over pretty much every terrain. Whether that’s a positive thing or not is up to you, but I think it takes away from the immersive nature of moving through the map. The map is also empty, not enough monsters at all. There’s also not a lot of verticality in the map. It makes exploration dull. The background views don’t really change. 4/10

Combat: easily the best aspect of the game. It feels crisp and the animations really carry the fight. I’m not completely sold on the longevity of the combat system though. It does start to feel samey after a while and there is no overarching system (example: elemental system from genshin) that really makes a difference in how characters are meant to interact and flow with each other. Still easily my most positive experience with the game. 8/10

Graphics: there’s a strange blur to the characters and backgrounds that makes you wonder if you’re developing cataracts. I’m not sure what’s going on, but the game doesn’t look as good as advertised. When I saw demo footage, I genuinely had thoughts about the graphics being on par with Genshin, depending on the individual’s general taste. However, my experience with this launch, while playing on maxed settings, didn’t impress me. I like most character designs. 6/10

Technical performance and bugs: some people are having issues, while others are having smooth performance. Unfortunately, I drew the short end of the stick. Lots of stuttering, lag, visual glitches. Dialogue boxes were cutting out lines. Field dialogue were cutting into each other and repeating 3-4x sometimes. Lots and lots of bugs in general. There were also apparently 3 redemption codes for rewards and only 1 worked for me. That’s embarrassing. 2/10

Voices/Localization: EN terrible. There was no voice direction here at all. The recording qualities were bad and the lines were unnatural and performed with no energy. I switched to JP, but it’s still noticeably not the best. General localization was also mediocre and plays into the terrible story. For example, why would Kuro translate “dragon” in Chinese to “Loong” in English, THEN write a tiny translator note on top to clarify that “Loong” means dragon, when it could have been simply localized as “dragon” in the first place? Just makes things needlessly more confusing. And of course, these details combined with the billions of fictional terminology basically makes it unreadable. There’s so many other examples I won’t go into. 5/10 (taking into account EN and JP)

Music: almost all generic elevator EDM. I think Kuro did all their music in-house for the most part, and it really shows here. It’s disappointing for a game that revolves around sounds as an overall theme. Was not as wuthering as I’d hoped. 5/10

**Final score: 4.5/10 as of launch**

\-------------------

Let me preface this by saying, this post was inspired by all the discord around the love interests rover might have.

While I personally want to make fun of this conversation. I think its a good idea to talk about this from a narrative perspective. Because I feel like a lot of players are either skipping dialogue. Or not properly digesting the information.

The actual theory is not that long, but in order to explain it, I will need to establish alot of background info first.

The information is complied from both ingame sources , wiki, and various content creators including reddit . I will link all the sources of my information

don't worry for all you gacha players that hate reading. I will include pictures . .

The conclusion and TLDR is a the end

This heavily implies that strong emotions can cause a person to overclock, rather than simply being overused.

Most resonators have some form of emotional trauma during there stages of overclocking. 

https://preview.redd.it/b5uwx7szjq1e1.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=781d40c49b293b4b01555369fb57903b74bc78f1

Scar himself seems to use overclocking freely with no adverse side effects. Thus removing the idea that it is only negative emotions.

Yangyang however, has a history of overclocking and seems to have since stabilized. 

https://preview.redd.it/g49ds7aelq1e1.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1bd6bdac67d176e88d50a12d17c51b61368013b

YangYang is a very soft spoken person and very rarely shows signs of excessive emotions. One could imagine that for a person like her to overclock, it must of been a traumatic experience. 

Or in other words, excessive stress = Overclocking

It is also mentioned in other profiles, that overclocking has the potential to harm those around them, even if not directly caused by the resonator. I[t is mentioned that mortefi caused a fire in desrock highland](https://wutheringwaves.fandom.com/wiki/Mortefi/Forte_Examination_Report) from his overclocked state.

# Camellya

\-------------

[During Camellya's companion quest,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Re5mROFxE&t=408s) we learn that Rover has the ability to help people, even after they overclocked. Camellya was on the verge of turning into a tacet discord, but somehow rover managed to snap her back to reality

https://preview.redd.it/pj3friglnq1e1.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a2af6bff72ec986aedaab84593c2b0ad52e27dd

While some of this comes across as flirty, or pandering to the MC. There is a subtle undertone beneath all of it.

https://preview.redd.it/fxbcg8k0oq1e1.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=3659f7d739c4f2ca36676c88d7cb4c43ef1bfab6

It's implying that rover may hold the keys to suppressing peoples overclock states.

And as soon as he left, camellya goes into a downward spiral towards overclocking

# Special Girl/Boy Rover

\-------------

There is a constant reminder in the story, that rover has a unique frequency: ( [Sanhua's introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmO9U1Zwq8Y) )

https://preview.redd.it/vzy121s3vq1e1.png?width=1477&format=png&auto=webp&s=348eb520520ffa12f480b6715089a340423968a1

But in addition to that. Rover also seems to be VERY acutely aware of sounds. in fact, alot of his voice-lines seem to be about ""listening"" to the world.

https://preview.redd.it/t3etfb3nuq1e1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc3d2815d3e29a0f25c0a913496f9090e1ad641

They can even hear people far easier than others. ( From camellya's story quest )

https://preview.redd.it/pcsx9bjbqq1e1.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fdb2a86e31b16a70d2f3e1b0e5e2f7a5056e8b0

\---------------

# ABBY 

\---------------

At the start of 1.1 main quest, Yangyang relays with us what baizhi said. The creature inside of us, we later called abby, is heavily linked to rover in many ways. We can share each others feelings, energies, and even thoughts

https://preview.redd.it/zjh877awtq1e1.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d63759a5f219e4b177dd0d1bcfc425fe699cdf6

Additionally Abby can even sense when we are in danger. And seems to find negative energies delicious.

https://preview.redd.it/331s19a3xq1e1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=a070d6d4a49494c02b913d982003dc1164b94e49

If Abby finds things like the dreamless delicious, while dreamless herself is mad out of unresolved wishes. It can imply that Abby eats negative emotions. 

The more negative it is, the more it entices Abby to eat it. 

And if abby is a reflection of rover, what does that mean for them?

\---------------

# Baizhi + You'tan

\---------------

Baizhi herself holds alot of lore and info regarding rover. She is the primary source we have for understanding ourselves and the world around us, and its a crucial plot point to moving the world forward. Whenever the devs want to info dump onto us, they deliver it through baizhi .  She also just happens mentions rovers unique sound related powers.

https://preview.redd.it/22ke0wowxq1e1.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=d89246b740db1c4927bd17f6c2a6cadf5fa3ae5b

In her Thoughts 2 page. She implies that remnant creatures ( things like You'tan ) are the embodiment souls, that attach themselves to people who share similar frequencies. And that rover is constantly attracting mutterflies towards them.

https://preview.redd.it/mw51msencr1e1.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=24f1b38f690b15867d46da875baeb87368a48f0d

For Baizhi, you'tan was not part of her originally. She found it during an expedition and resonated with it during a TD outbreak , that ended up killing her crew. This has caused her to close up for a bit, and become a bit distant towards others.

But the most interesting part comes from her Final unlocked thoughts. 

https://preview.redd.it/wbsxizo3yq1e1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c59c2cd676bd7e2bf9e40f29a655009e2a48d42

She goes from being indifferent, to becoming self aware, that she is slowly gaining attachment to us. Again. On the surface this is no more than typical fan service. Things you tell people to get them interested in a character. But for baizhi who is known to others as cold and keeping a respectable distance. It is out of character for her to open up to people. Even with the context of being the MC, it implies rover is special to her.

\---------------------------------

# Mutterflies

\---------------------------------

You probably seen these things around and have no idea what they are. They are called mutter flies as mentioned via in game patch notes from time to time. They are hinted as remnant creatures, which is a fancy way of saying energy creature

https://preview.redd.it/z130vkp58r1e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=6467fd129592caaa191b1686cbbc82e0d1874fb3

As far as I know, baizhi is the only one to mention them in game. And they seem to be mainly attracted to rover. Context clues points to the fact that we guide them to inactive tacetites, which is just a substance of energy

It is not mentioned anywhere why energy creatures are guided towards energy substances. But we can speculate about that later

\---------------------------------

\---------------------------------

\---------------------------------

#      SO HERE IS THE THEORY

\-------------------------------

\---------------------------------

\---------------------------------

with all the context out of the way, we can finally discuss the entire point of this post.

For this last piece of info.  Instead of using the the words I explained before, like resonator. I instead want to use the word Psychic.

 It will may seem confusing at first, but I think this explanation a lot easier to understand.

**Wuthering waves intentionally hides obvious information behind confusing jargon to make it seem alot more complex than what it is.** 

For that reason, I am opting to use a familiar term people might understand easier, to explain why this theory makes sense.  so bare with me. 

BASICALLY :

* The majority of this games premise can be described as a psychic awakening. Where psychic powers ( waveform phenomena ) were unleashed in the world, and people can now use this form of psychic energy ( Frequencies )
* A lot of psychics ( resonators ) started to appear in the world and discovered they had the ability to use spiritual powers ( forte ), by harmonizing with the world ( Reverberations ).
* But not all energy is good, and negative energy can cause chaotic outbreaks ( Lament )
* If a psychic's mental state is not kept in check, there powers can be unleashed and cause havoc for those around them ( Overclocking ), by turning a lot of the positive energy into negative energy  ( Think of Mob Psycho 100 )
* Rover has the unique ability to harmonize with the world, and does not get affected by the negative psychic energy (Remnant energy).
* In fact, he has a spiritual guardian that he shares a strong bond with, who can eat negative energy ( abby ).
* Heavy Implying that rover themselves has the ability ( even if its passive ) to stabilize and calm excessive energy.
* They also are very sensitive to this energy via sounds 
* And can even guide lost spirits ( Mutterflies ) back to there place of rest. ( Tacetites )



So what does this all mean?

In media one of the core components of any psychic. is the ability to influence or even control someones mind or even emotional state. This is consistent with what we have seen throughout the game so far, via tacet discords and lingering resentment from remnant energy.

**if the entire games terminology can be analogous to sounds. If we changed the word Resonator to Psychic, Sound could be changed to Soul.**

Rover could QUITE LITERALLY, have a soul (Frequency) so powerful, that it can influence other psychic's (resonators) souls, subconsciously putting them at ease. Removing all there negative energy.

This game could be hinting at the fact that rover can absorb, or at very least pacify negative remnant energy, without Abby. Thus creating a natural charm, that draws people closer. Thus saving them from the risk of overclocking, even if they don't realize it.

\------------------

TL : DR

So every time we joke about sleeping with changli. It is cannon that we are doing it to save her. 

let us save changli kuro. Kuro! let us save her!

reddit_search_1iwewqx,My thoughts on Wuthering Waves,"Let's go point by point, things I believe are good AND bad. I'm not going to use ""It's gacha game"" as an excuse for anything.

**Story:**

\+ the concept of Lament is interesting and It's a good hook for the story.

\+ the social ranks adds more authenticity into the cities since we can see more about what is happening behind the curtain of first impression.

\- Rover's memory lost - very lazy way to start plot. We don't even know why she wants to regain her memories. Feeling of purpose? Need to help the world? Meet someone? Achive something? We just know she wants to regain her memories just because. The concept of ""you're connected to this world"" is not explored at all, leaving us with nothing to root for her as main character.

\- Scar as antaghonist. Don't get me wrong, he's a great character, lots of personallity, interesting way to guide the story BUT he appeared in 1.0 and last seen or mentioned in 1.1. The game seem to completely forgot about him leading to inconsistensy in plot. Intead of exploring Fractsidus we just get more and more organizations so the one that was introuced to us in 1.0 as big and dangerous is now completely meaningless.

\- Every ""big story quest"" is completely separated from the rest, the only thing that connects them is Rover and Lament. Feels like unfinished, different stories that just happen is the same world. The order you do those quests does not matter at all. The only thing that connects Black Shores and Rinascita is that one letter/invite we got from Shorekeeper. No foreshadowing for next location, no lesson that we learnt that will be useful in the next destination. Plot just forgets about them as soon as we go further.

\- The main plot just doesn't exist in this world. It's seems like they tried to do Genshin's acts that are separated stories but forgot that they're connected by plot and push us forward in main story. The only hook at this point is Lament, the only reason for us to keep going is to regain memories. In Genshin the more you experience, the more goals you have. It started as ""find our sibling"" and later we're involved in crazy things with many goals. Every destination adds something to our purpose. When in WuWa It's still just ""regain memories"" everything else is temporary an lost as soon as we leave to another location.

\- A lot of dropped things that are ""Big"" not explored by plot at all. No foreshadowing for them to be brought back later.

\- No foreshadowing in general. Because there is no main story as a whole and everything that happens is separated, the foreshadowing last for at best, 1, maybe 2 quests.  Everything is resolved as soon as we get some info drop about it, leaves us with no space for theories, anticipation and feeling of something bigger in the corner.

**Character's design (the personality part):**

\+ there is some diversity

\+ Most of the characters play part in main story for their region

\+ Interesting male characters

\- Character's have little to no personality (mostly accur to women). Seems like main trait for all of them is ""being attractive"" and simp for Rover. The role they play in main plot is important but does not have any emotional impact. Some could be replaced by a mascot and It would require very little rewritting. That also make them predictable and does not allow player getting attached to them for longer that one patch. Because of that there is nothing more to say. Judging character's personality when there's no diversity is meaningless.

**Character's desing (visual aspects judged by main principles for character design, not just how It looks):**

\+ They look stunning visually

\+ the amount of details and work putted in rendering is impressive

\- Not depth. The designs seems to fit them at first but the deeper you go in the plot the more you see how shallow they are. No detailes connected to their past, no symbolism, no foreshadowing.

\- Because for all character's the main color is white or black with one color as an accent, there is no space to use colors to match the personality of the character. Even that one color sometimes does not fit in terms of color language in character design.

\- Very weird physics when It comes to breasts. Even when character is standing still they're jiggly like some jelly. The gravity is generally bit off in this game.

\- Using one main trait as entire inspiration for character. Carlotta is from mafia? Lets make her like stereotypical, anime mafia girl. Cantarella - jelly fish. Jinshi - dragon. Brant - pirate and circus (this is one of the most interesting designs since he got two main traits), Shorekeeper - butterflies. This does not tell character's story or their past/connections. This gives us only one main thing about them.

\- Contrast. The characters either blend with everything having the same value or there's too much contrast: basically very heavy dark element and everything else is just bright. It's very visible when you look at them with no saturation - the most basic way to check If your character's design is good. There should be different values for everything, especially for elements you want to stand out that complements a whole image.

\- Terrible sexualization of female characters. I don't have anything against characters to be sexy with exposed skin, flirty sttitude but you can do both: sexy and classy, still very elegant and charming. It just look like Kuro took path od least resistance to get players attention by focusing on fanservice. Just like some low quality, low efford gachas.

I understand It's Gacha and this genry is based on goonerbait BUT It's not an excuse for bad design in game that is prased for their designs. If someone is creating character for goonerbaiting pupose only, without a single care about plot, personality etc. then It's no longer ""Game first, gacha second""  it's pure ""Gacha mostly, game just by the way""

**Voice acting:**

\+ playing with accents is fun (that point is also in \[-\] section)

\+ male character's voiced very well, fit their personallity 100%

\- All female adult character's sound exaclty the same: sleepy, unbothered, ""attractive"" (almost in seductive way) Even in emotional moments, when they bring sad things to them, are angry, clenching hand in fist, there is no emotions in their voice. I'm not blaming VAs I'm blaming voice director. Their voices also sometimes completely don't match the character's visual presentation which lead to breaking immersion. Not diversity in the way they're portrayed by their voice makes me feel that they're all have the same personality: calm, calculated, flirty.

\- Bacause of the amount of ""calm and sleepy"" voices It's hard to go through entire quest in one go (I got tired after 15 min and had to go for some combat to woke up a bit)

\- Accents are... weird. Kuro said that they won't be forcing British VAs to do american accent but they still do force them to do any other accent. That leads to many mispronunciations that could be forgiven in normal circumstances, yet hard to ignore since characters sounds like they should be able to pronounce them correctly. The accents are also problematic since sometimes they disappear or accure to everything but the words that should be native to the character. Not to mention that some accents were suppose to sound like x accent but since VAs are not natives - the accent is who knows what.

**Storytelling:**

This point would need a whole different post since It's very deep topic with a lot of things to discuss. I'll keep It simple: I can's say anything good about WuWa's storytellling. It's just bad, in some parts more or less. The best proof for my statement is the pure joy of WuWa's players for ability to skip entire main quest. In games with good or at least mid storytelling players would not be happy for that option rather than joy they would express their concerns about ruining immersion, leading to misunderstanding the plot and lowering the emotional impact of It. Even It's good points have big \[-\] to them.

**Enviroment design:**

\+ looks stunning

\+ some places are breathtaking

\+ very detailed

\+ NPC's animations in cities

\- Inconsistent. Sometimes when you see a location from distance you just see some colors and ruins but when you got closed (like, really close) you can see that sky is completely different on this part of the map, yet you saw nothing like that from far away. Flying object, giant hole that appears only If you enter the location. It gives feeling like in old games when different locations were in fact just different layer of the map. (Like you're not in open world but going from one domain to another)

\- Very... empty. A lot of open spaces with nothing to do, some villages without a single NPC or hidden story. Like the only things you can actually explore are those few locations. Thank goodness they added flying mode in Rinascita, running through so much unexplorable terrain would be just painful.

\- Looks like they focused efford only on important locations just filling the gaps between them with emptyness.

\- The amount of those empty spaces is huge. Travelling from one point to another without fast movement can take forever since the teleports are so far away.

\- Incontistancy when It comes to sizes. You see a building quite big from the outside. You go inside and suddenly It's twice as big when It comes to the height and length. I tried to check If It's just my perception but no. Running around the building can take even 10 seconds less than when you run from entry to exit inside (take in account that running around is not straight line, so It should take even more time than run inside the building)

**Exploration:**

\+ QoL mechanics for fast travel

\+ Beautiful views

\+ Special enemies/mini bosses

\- Another thing that just don't exist as a whole...

\- No hidden story, notes, infoes within eviroment

\- ""Secret locations"" are marked on map, why they can't allow us to discover them by ourselves? What ""secret"" It is If simply marked on map?

\- No intriguing layers on map, like cave systems, forgotten ruins hidden deep under the surface, everytime I've entered some ""Secret Location"" It was just small cave with exit right in front my eyes with few enemies inside. Giving you hope of something bigger only to discover that there is nothing.

\- No random quest chains related to main plot

\- Giant locations with nothing to offer beside beautiful view.

No wonder players are grateful for fast travel as the exploration is just boring, shallow, meaningless, based on farming materials, without any connection to main plot, packed with giant empty spaces with just few chests at best.

**Combat:**

\+ very interesting idea of outro and intro that provides buffs

\+ well done dodge/parry system

\+ skill based

\+ different enemies attack patterns

\+ generally well done

\- reflex based, you can't make up for It's lack

\- slow mo that interrupts rythm

\- dodge/parry very basic, no factors that would affect It. In Dark Souls there's multiple ways you can improve your dodge speed, parry by sacrificing another thing like heavy but very protective armor.

\- different attack styles in characters that does not affect your play style since It's still based on dodging and the way you attack does not affect It.

\- elements without much purpose, added completely unnecessary

\- generally not flexible combat, you either have reflects or not, you can't really use healer as main DPS for example. Even with unleashing full potencial of characters - the DMG is not that big which makes fight tiring and long, attack, dodge, switch.

**music:**

\+ very beautiful

\+ different music for different locations

\+ Inspiration from real world

\- Sometimes music does not fit the on screen action. When you fight an enemy you should have someting to encourage you to try harder not to just running around and listen. For some bosses music is way to soft to make you feel the gravity of the fight or too melancholic to stay focused.

\- Music that don't tell any story. It's just there, beautiful but leaving no hints. Music have incredible impact on storytelling, makes you feel what happened in certain location without telling you anything directly or to get the general atmosphere.

\- Wasted potencial for synchronizing music with enemy's movements, giving you hints like when to parry, when to dodge, when to attack, is It your opponet's weak moment or increased resistance for your attacks.

**cutscenes:**

\+ beautiful

\+ quite a lot of them

\- Too chaotic

\- focus mostly on character expression with camera flying around all the time - this make it hard to focus or understand what is actually going on.

\- Too much slow mo, It should be used to put an impact on most important moments not to just exaggerate cool character's movements.

\- Lack of meaning when It comes to the story, cutscenes are another powerful storytelling tool. Creating emotional impact, deliver informations in very visual way. For WuWa the cutscenes are mostly used to show cool fights, to explore only current in game moment not to give you more infos or understanding of the situation.

symbolism:

\+ nice references to Italy in Rinascita.

\- actual meaning of some symbols is very twisted. For example masks in Venecia are used as symbol of lack of social norms or ranks, where evryone are equal - in Rinascita you have very important and visible social structure. To show loosing identity, being completely anonymous, society as collective instead of individuals. Rinascita is focused on individuals, everyone have their identity and role established. The carnival masks also symbolise chaos, lack of rules without any balance. Rinascita already have strict rules and they try to achive balance, nothing is chaoting. Everyting is very calculated - including characters.

\- symbols are very shallow, not used for foreshadowing as It should be.

To those unaware, a similar circumstance happened in 2020 with Cyberpunk 2077 where the game had to be taken off the shelves due to being similarly undercooked. 

It may not be a gacha game but, in my opinion as a self-respecting consumer, all games should be held to higher standards than being unplayable and horribly unoptimised at launch. 

As long as people keep allowing this to happen, you might see games like Project Mugen, Arknights Endfield or even Azur Promilia underdeliver cause they do not feel threatened enough to release their games in a proper state. 

So, I ask of you fellow self-respecting gamers to not, in any way, excuse the clearly unprepared launch of Wuthering Waves. Force companies to treat you better as a whole, not just Hoyoverse.

I have to say: HOLY COW this game is so generous!  In the week that I’ve devoted to this game, I’ve been inundated with so many limited characters I don’t even know what to do with them.  I was able to pick up Solacetune from the “standard” (?) banner before it reset, I grabbed both Pyroath and Startrail from the limited banner.  With all the black cards they gave me from all of the events and the story etc, I was also able to pick up the 6* sig weapons for all three of them, as well as Pyroath and Startrail’s CUBs!

I then find out that you could *literally buy* limited characters from the dorm shop using limited currency, so l grabbed Lucid Dreamer (I don’t know if he’s meta or not but I already love him 😍).  I’m working on getting Alisa Echo now using the dorm stuff.

At this point, I was already ridiculously impressed.  I saw there was an event that you could do that involved Bianca Stigmata, and so I kept doing it (it was free and there were some ok rewards) and I thought at the end you got her coating.  But when I got there, lo and behold, it wasn’t her coating — Kuro legit just gave me a copy of her!!

A few days later, the update happens, and I find out that we got a Lucid Dreamer for free?!!? AND her weapon??!!! For *free*? And next to her you also got a #21: Feral??!!? On top of all this, I saw that the “standard” banner also reset so I grabbed a Luna Oblivion!

I go back and tell my friend about this, and he respond: you know… there’s a DMC collab coming up, and they’re *giving us a free Dante*

Like is this game even real??  I thought Kuro was already being generous in WuWa, but PGR is on a whole different level of treating your players right.

At this moment I don’t even really care about meta, I just wanted to grab all the cool-looking characters that I could.  And honestly, I really wish that this is the industry standard moving forward.  I’m at the point where I just want to throw my credit card at Kuro Games.  I think I’m going to go pick up some coatings (that Tsubaki coating is *peak*).

I want to end this appreciation post with a couple of questions:

1.) Am I missing any free stuff?  Honestly the one thing I will criticize this game on is that there are SO many menus that it can be a little overwhelming and hard to navigate and I don’t want to leave any stone unturned.

2.) I know there is a lot of discussion around “catching up” to CN and while conceptually, I understand what it means, but are there any implications I should keep in mind? (I know some people were posting about how things are going to slow down but I don’t know what this game is like during the “normal” times).

3.) How was your own experience as a new player? Mine has been absolutely fantastic so far and I can’t believe I’ve been sleeping on PGR all this time, but I don’t know if I am the rule or the exception

Lastly, 4.) For those of you who play WuWa, do you think this generosity will make its way over there as well?  Or are the two games just so vastly different that Kuro won’t apply the same philosophies to Wuthering Waves?

reddit_search_1df1ntb,Surprised Kuro Games went with a 50/50 for Limited Characters,"Before starting Wuthering Waves I checked out Punishing Gray Raven to see how Kuro Games handles gacha banners and powercreep. After seeing that in PGR the limited character banner has a 100% rate up and there is no 50/50 I was a bit disappointed to see that Wuthering Waves has a 50/50 for the limited character banner.   
I'm kinda hoping that Kuro Games either gives out enough free pulls that the 50/50 isn't a big issue or they remove the 50/50 in the future. I haven't played a lot of different Gacha games though so I don't know how PGR and Wuthering Waves compare to others though.

Just reset it weekly, add some astrites idc, add echo exp and tuners, add sub stats reroller or selector whatever it is to make it even more goated, and add weekly boss mat boxes, Change Ui.

reddit_search_1cyme0b,"Brief Wuthering Waves Review, Straight to the Point","Going to summarize various issues I have with the game.

Story: it’s by and far the worst aspect of the game. The devs saying they rewrote 90% of the story post cbt1 was a huge red flag in hindsight. It’s a cliche plot, but that’s generally a lot of gachas. What kills the story is the delivery. It’s ass to the max. You’re thrown fictional jargon on every new line, and they basically never bring it up again, so you’re just wondering what the point of introducing so much pointless terminology was. And for the other terminology that is actually lore-relevant, there’s just so much of it, sometimes 3-4 random terms you can barely remember thrown in a single textbox that you’re immediately turned off. Please fix the story. 2/10

Exploration: the movements are janky. I know the exact people out there that were praising this game’s parkour and exploration to high heaven during cbt2, but we have to be honest. It’s janky, glitchy, and not always intuitive. You also pretty much press the run+forward button and you can cross over pretty much every terrain. Whether that’s a positive thing or not is up to you, but I think it takes away from the immersive nature of moving through the map. The map is also empty, not enough monsters at all. There’s also not a lot of verticality in the map. It makes exploration dull. The background views don’t really change. 4/10

Combat: easily the best aspect of the game. It feels crisp and the animations really carry the fight. I’m not completely sold on the longevity of the combat system though. It does start to feel samey after a while and there is no overarching system (example: elemental system from genshin) that really makes a difference in how characters are meant to interact and flow with each other. Still easily my most positive experience with the game. 8/10

Graphics: there’s a strange blur to the characters and backgrounds that makes you wonder if you’re developing cataracts. I’m not sure what’s going on, but the game doesn’t look as good as advertised. When I saw demo footage, I genuinely had thoughts about the graphics being on par with Genshin, depending on the individual’s general taste. However, my experience with this launch, while playing on maxed settings, didn’t impress me. I like most character designs. 6/10

Technical performance and bugs: some people are having issues, while others are having smooth performance. Unfortunately, I drew the short end of the stick. Lots of stuttering, lag, visual glitches. Dialogue boxes were cutting out lines. Field dialogue were cutting into each other and repeating 3-4x sometimes. Lots and lots of bugs in general. There were also apparently 3 redemption codes for rewards and only 1 worked for me. That’s embarrassing. 2/10

Voices/Localization: EN terrible. There was no voice direction here at all. The recording qualities were bad and the lines were unnatural and performed with no energy. I switched to JP, but it’s still noticeably not the best. General localization was also mediocre and plays into the terrible story. For example, why would Kuro translate “dragon” in Chinese to “Loong” in English, THEN write a tiny translator note on top to clarify that “Loong” means dragon, when it could have been simply localized as “dragon” in the first place? Just makes things needlessly more confusing. And of course, these details combined with the billions of fictional terminology basically makes it unreadable. There’s so many other examples I won’t go into. 5/10 (taking into account EN and JP)

Music: almost all generic elevator EDM. I think Kuro did all their music in-house for the most part, and it really shows here. It’s disappointing for a game that revolves around sounds as an overall theme. Was not as wuthering as I’d hoped. 5/10

**Final score: 4.5/10 as of launch**

If you start your journey on PS5™, you can later switch to PC or mobile platforms by logging in with the same Kuro Games account linked to your PSN account. Your progress will carry over seamlessly. Similarly, if you begin on PC or mobile, you can continue on PS5™ using the same Kuro Games account. 
    
&nbsp; 

>**Q: Which servers are available for the PS5™ version of Wuthering Waves?**

>A: The PS5™ version supports Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, America, and HMT (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) servers. However, the available server is determined by the region of your PSN account. For example:

>A PSN account registered in North America will access the America Server.

>A PSN account registered in Hong Kong will access the HMT Server.

reddit_search_1bff844,A Review of Wuthering Waves CBT 2,"**I got annoyed how my previous post got split into two pieces and I still don't know how to cross post from the WuWa subreddit, so I deleted it and then re-uploaded my review as its own separate post**

**PRELUDE**

As CBT2 nears its end, I feel the need to put my thoughts onto paper and leave my own rambling mess on a video game that hasn't even released yet. I am going to sound overall quite negative about the game but this is done from a place of love. I am actually very, incredibly excited about the game and would not have gone to such efforts to write this if I didn't care deeply. There's also going to be a lot of direct comparisons to Genshin but this is inevitable as Genshin is the basis which WuWa was made.

As a preface for those who care about gamer cred, I am Tacet level 40, databank level 19. I have cleared all of the permanent Tower of Adversity floors and have cleared some of the floors on the third page too. I have beaten all holograms up to difficulty IV and the only reason I didn't go further is because I am a medical resident working in the ICU and I really don't have the time to mald like that right now. I have completed all of the main story, all of the rogue like domains, and all of the parkour event. I have several world quests, character quests, and side quests completed, all without not skipping dialogue unless it was blatantly untranslated. In total, I think I have cleared about 80% of all the unique content the game has to offer.

I am primarily an RPG player with some forray into action RPGs. One of my first games was Morrowind...on the classic xbox. I have since played every bethesda release until Fallout 76, every deus ex game, every shadow run, every system shock, neverwinter nights, dragon age origins, divine divinity, original sin 1 and 2, most recently baldur's gate 3, and much much more. More importantly, I have played the games which served as the seminal influence for Kuro Games' development ethos: Nier Automata, Honkai 3rd, and Genshin Impact. 

I am also a veteran of gacha games. Considering I started with Girls Frontline on its global release, I probably started playing gacha earlier than most on even the gacha gaming subreddit. My gacha resume includes Arknights, HI3, PGR, Project snowbreak, ToF, Artery Gear, and, of course, Genshin Impact. Of these, Genshin has remained my mainstay - I full clear all limited events, am completely up to date on the story, and without fail have 36 starred every abyss since patch 1.3. 

All this to say, Kuro games made Wuthering Waves for me personally. I am the target demographic.


**COMBAT**

To put the best foot forward and the part Kuro games spent their most effort on, the combat of WuWa is certainly the most appealing part of the game. It's evident the devs spent a lot of effort to create many different enemies and movesets, characters with smooth, snappy, flashy animations, all blended together with the satisfying feeling of perfect dodges and parries. It's certainly no lie that the game feel is on the level of console action RPGs. And while it does not reach the heights of stuff like Bayonetta or DMC, it is at least on par with games like Nier Automata. My experience with PGR also tells me Kuro games knows how to make a good boss fight and I feel that quality has transferred over to Wuthering Waves. Calamity class enemies feel weighty and imposing. There is a fun back and forth dance to be had as you try to find openings in their aggression. Most bosses have decently telegraphed moves and few bullshit attacks/mechanics. Some exceptions are Mourning Aix's homing lasers and the big monkey's spin to win being attacks that the average player will realistically only learn how to dodge after being hit in the face a couple times. However, as good as the combat feels, Kuro didn't make a spectacle fighter, they made an open world RPG. Because of that, it is not sufficient to judge WuWa based on only its minute to minute gameplay.


**TEAMBUILDING**

One of the biggest disappointments I had from the transition of CBT 1 to CBT 2 is the wholesale removal of their elemental concerto system to a more ToF-like intro/outro skill system. The old concerto gave team buffs based on the element of the intro and outro unit. It had a universality that allowed most characters to have some degree of synergy with each other although certain units would benefit from certain element combos better. The effects themselves were rather plain with a lot being duplicates but that is a matter of needing refinement and not a good reason to scrap the system. Now synergies are much more rigid. Sanhua is your ice buffer. Taoqi is your skill buffer. Mordefi is your heavy attack buffer. Aalto is your aero buffer. DanJin is a havoc buffer for a havoc dps that doesn't exist yet. And the game suffers for it.

Concerto energy exists to encourage field time for all of your characters in a team. I think that is appropriate, considering quick swaps interferes with the spectacle fighter like combat style Kuro goes for. However, if you make a system that requires all characters to use field time, then all characters need to be able to deal damage or at least buff enough to justify field time. As things are right now, because of how intro/outro skill works it is very difficult to justify using much of the roster, especially for new players whose rosters are very limited. Characters like Sanhua or Aalto now simply do not contribute enough damage unless they are paired with an ice dps or aero dps, respectively.

If you've paid attention recently. A lot of CBT2 showcase videos are essentially ""DanJin solo hologram VI"". This may sound impressive but the catch is, when dps is on the line and you are fighting against the timer, it is easier to clear with solo Danjin than it is by playing her in a full team. This holds true for other characters too. I have equally invested into LinYin, YuanWu, YangYang, TaoQi, DanJin, Mortefi, BaiZhi, Rover and Encore. Unbuilt characters include Sanhua and Aalto. In my experience, it is better dps for me to on field Encore and only briefly swap to another unit to use encore's outro skill and then immediately swap back to encore. 

The Genshin equivalent would be every support being like Faruzan or Gorou. Imagine if Genshin didn't have Bennett, Yelan, Furina, Kazuha, Sucrose, the Viridicent venerer artifact set, and all the other relatively universal buffers. It would rightly be called terrible.


**MUSIC**

Music is a key part to immersion in an open world game. I'm going to make a hot take and say that it actually is more important than gameplay for an open world game. Take Skyrim as an example. Stripped to its studs, it is a mechanically easier game to play than even Genshin. Its also an RPG that had simplified its RPG mechanics to such a barebones state that people have constantly modded combat overhauls for the past decade to add complexity back into the game. Also, much of its story and characters, particularly in the main quest, are poorly written. Yet, Skyrim remains one of the best selling games of all time. A lot of this I can attribute to its music. The music has such a warm, inviting, yet grand sensation that compelled me to play a game which, in retrospect, I should not have enjoyed so much.

As for Wuwa, a game whose theme revolves around sound, I find it's OST to be mediocre. When listened to on its own I would describe most combat and overworld music as ""servicable"". When taken in its whole, I would describe it as ""surprisingly un-immersive"". As an example, the overworld music can be aptly described as muted rather than just calm. This goes in stark contrast with the heavy emphasis on base and percussion, along with the beeps and boops that plays during combat. If anyone in the beta wants to know what I mean, explore Desorock Highland for a minute and then go fight the Impermanence Heron. The two soundtracks are like from completely different games. It's actually jarring.

I'm going to start throwing out a lot of WuWa's ost, so I'll be referring to a youtube video by ""lord of chaos"" for futher reference but I won't link directly due to the risk of having my whole post deleted. Tracks 9, 16, 43, and 46 are typical examples of the overworld music. 26 is a piece I want to specifically compare to the [city ruins theme from Nier Automata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMw-DUnR10s) as I feel they both go for the same piercing, lonely, melancholic feel. Comparing the multilayered harmony from Nier only makes WuWa's plainess all the more evident. 

To put my thoughts in sum, Wuthering Waves is afraid of using a strong melody which makes a lot of the OST not leave a strong impression. Tracks 17, 27, 40 are good examples on how the music kind of all just blends together. They put heavy focus on the rhythmic percussion and bass but de-emphasize the melody. It makes every track feel the same way ""urgent and fast"" just as every overworld piece feels ""muted"". And when we do get to hear a melody it can be pretty uninspired, in particular the [main city theme track 42](https://youtu.be/LtlJNXaOC3c?si=VtMc_FMPpgCCZZkD&t=321) (apologies for the poor quality but this is the only video with the complete piece).

I'm going to use the Genshin soundtrack as the comparison. As mentioned, music is a key part to immersion in an open world game and so with WuWa and Genshin's open world being so similar, it is only fair to compare the two. Genshin has an incredible sound track that carries the mood of the environment very well. It is very melody forward and takes center stage when exploring the overworld. Also like Skyrim, Genshin has a warmth and invitingness to the ambient music that begs the player to stay for a while. Places like

[Enkanomiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdPItALzXnI) are just so memorable by their sound tracks alone. 

This is NOT just because of the fully orchestrated sound track. Here is a sample of Genshin's beta OSTs. These are MIDI files and so should be fully achievable by Wuthering waves and Vanguard sound

[Inazuma City Theme](https://youtu.be/zCUOpvfL5p0?si=xckVkzNL_4jtLn7h&t=611)

WuWa has some standout pieces, don't get me wrong. The first handful of tracks on the referred video are all bangers. Track 5 in particular is an example of what the main city theme should be and I am utterly confused why they don't use it instead. The problem is, I don't hear these songs often. I didn't realize half of them were even in the game until I started researching for the review.

**OPEN WORLD AND QUESTING**

The heart and soul of an open world game is its open world, is it not? WuWa's open world is quite similar to Genshin so there's not really much for me to say. The environments are beautiful and I do find myself staring at the scenery on occassion. It make exploring zones fun, although I wish they made character ascension material more common to find. Mobility is greater than Genshin but at the cost of decreased density in locations of interest. Its a trade off that is ultimately personal preference and so i won't make any judgements.

What I do have issue with is the integration of the open world into gameplay, more specifically the world quests. World quests are opportunities for the player to make an impact on the game world. And so fittingly they are the biggest chance for the game to make an impact on the player. Unfortunately, of the world quests I have done, I only have left with feelings of disappointment and unmet expectations. I left an earlier comment on the matter and will repeat it here: 

The Guixu city quest was the best that I played as it had unique mechanics, a cool boss fight, and a weird but not unwelcome motorbike subway surfer session in the end. Problem being, I've fought that boss probably 20 times already for ascension mats before starting the world quest. What they need to do is make the first time you step into the boss arena be the trigger for the start of the world quest. If people just want to get their ascension mats then they can just put a large disclaimer at the beginning saying ""you can skip the world quest to unlock to boss but we highly recommend against it""

The Dim Forest toxic spores world quest is probably the worst just because of how anti-climactic the ending was. Thematically and in some ways mechanically it is identical to the Genshin Sacred Sakura quest line. You travel around the map, doing puzzles at specific spots, and ultimately cleanse a very special tree. Except in Genshin the puzzle spots are only told to you as descriptions of locations and it is up to the player to search them out whereas WuWa boringly just gives you a quest marker to each spot. Genshin also has a very special, one time only boss fight at the end which require you to complete the same style of puzzle, except this time in the middle of combat. WuWa instead has two monkeys, neither of them were even boss mobs, at the end. Very disappointing. They should honestly just go full hog and copy Genshin wholesale and make you have to solve puzzles while a constant stream of enemies pour in. It would be great if you had to balance clearing out mobs while trying to solve the puzzle and being cautious to make sure your AoE doesn't disrupt the work you've made so far.


**STORY**

Much ink has been spilled about the story and personally I find the changes to the early game story to be fine. The world ended up being a lot less ""post apocalyptic"" than the fanbase expected and so I think the more light hearted and less edgy presentation is fitting. Citizens are complaining about inane things, there is no military conscription, couriers are reprimanded for going to dangerous zones rather than being forced to trek into danger. There is a distinct sense that the world is starting to heal. Civilization has not needed to fundamentally change to adapt to the disaster. This is opposed to Arknights, where the concept of a city was destroyed and now any large population must live on mobile platforms in order to survive. I've heard WuWa described as Futuristic Xian xia and I would have to agree.

That is not to say the story isn't without its flaws. The early story beats are full of new terminology, names, and places. We are just not given enough time to process all of the information. For global players the issue is compounded by the scuffed translation and the fact that many names are in romanized Chinese. For example, in the very first moments of the game, the guardian dragon is interchangeably referred to as a dragon and then by its chinese name ""Long"". I am partially fluent in Chinese. I know enough to at least be able to feed and shelter myself, call a taxi to the airport, and buy a airplane ticket back home. Despite this, I am unable to remember the name of the main city hub and even sometimes forget the names of characters that I own. 

By the time I got to Scar, I had lost so much investment in the story that I found his story book sequence to be unwelcome and hammy. It gave me the feeling of someone that was ""trying too hard"", if you get what I mean. Granted, this is still the early story and it likely will improve later on, so I won't belabor my point. Genshin's story was also boring early on and Skyrim's story just plain sucks so obviously story isn't a dealbreaker.


**ENDGAME AND ECHOS**

Will be brief, relatively at least. WuWa's endgame appears to be functionally similar to Genshin. The differences being WuWa has holograms and echo farming is not an exact one to one with artifacts. Personally I am not someone who needs a lot of end game content. I find the early and midgame experience to be much more important. To put into context, I have bounced off every MMORPG I have played. I have never ever made it to level cap, let alone started farming for end game equipment. Other than in Genshin, I suppose. So I'm probably not the best person to talk about what makes good endgame. But this should also make evident the kind of playerbase WuWa will be attracting. As I stated in the beginning, I AM the target demographic, like it or not. To me, WuWa endgame is essentially just echo farming. And oh boy do I have some problems with the echo system. It could probably be a post of its own but to put my thoughts on echo farming into summary: rate of acquisition is both too low and too time consuming, the RNG is even worse than Genshin, solo players get shafted too hard, not having off piece is cancer.


**SUMMARY**

I think the core foundation of the game is strong (combat and open world) but what is built on top of the foundation (the content) needs work. Most are things that can reasonably improve with additional polish, its just a matter of time and whether Kuro would rather start looking into the future and make more content rather than improve the content they already made. Certainly I would prefer the latter but my understanding of Kuro's financial situation is that they have landed into a bit of a Mihoyo situation where they have staked everything on WuWa becoming profitable. So chances are Kuro is likely going to release a flawed product and try to build improvements as they continue to develop the game, also not unlike Mihoyo.

We are probably too far in to development to make further major changes to the concerto system but its probably a personal preference anyways, so I'm just going to have to live with it. Ultimately, I am still going to play the game on release and, unless the Echo system remains completely unchanged and it burns me out of the game, will likely remain as a regular player.

reddit_search_1d51cwb,"r/WutheringWaves and r/gachagaming on fire after Kuro Games leaked Japanese player's emails, and failing to give any compensation to players despite false advertising","**Context:** 

Wuthering Waves is an open-world RPG gacha game by Chinese game developer Kuro Games released on 22nd May. It was very anticipated in the gacha sphere, with many Content creators labelling it as the ""Genshin killer"". Genshin Impact is another popular gacha game that has dominated over the past 4 years (similar to how people call every new MMORPG the WoW killer). 

Before the release, WuWa (Wuthering Waves) had two closed beta tests, one on March 2023, and February earlier this year. There was [much praise](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1bfe1yj/a_review_of_wuthering_waves_cbt_2/) for WuWa's gameplay and combat, as it was the main selling point of the game and what differentiated it from Genshin Impact. However, there was also a lot of [criticism](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1br92qk/anyone_else_worried_about_localization/) regarding the localisation of the game to English and other languages, with many noticeable spelling and grammar mistakes in-game. Kuro Games reassured the global player base by making an [NDA Closed Beta Test](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1btw63z/therell_be_an_nda_cbt_for_localisation_from_april/) for localisation. Of course, players of the previous closed beta tests responded positively and r/WutheringWaves users were happy to see Kuro Games listening to their community (a phrase that would later turn into a satirical meme in r/gachagaming). On the other hand, r/gachagaming users were concerned with how late it was in development for them to be doing another Closed Beta Test, with the release date only being a couple months away.

When WuWa finally launched last week, there was a massive number of optimisation problems, with many players [unable to play](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cyhp1d/okay_i_cannot_deal_with_this_game_on_mobile/) the game as well as numerous [bugs and dialogue issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cylvho/known_issues_bug_fixes/). Most players agreed that the launch was rushed with the English localisation still being subpar, the voice acting being [awful](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1d2elkf/maybe_voice_acting_direction_is_important/) and the dialogue and story being [bloated and boring](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cyi39m/dialogues_feel_bloated_and_blend_the_story_has/). 

**Drama:**

Weapons in WuWa can be purchased with in-game currency in the store, with each weapon having different effects. However, there was a [mistranslation with the Japanese text](https://x.com/hxg_diluc/status/1795849274682749361) concerning how to weapon worked in combat. Players in Japan were purchasing this weapon despite the Japanese text being different from the actual effects of the weapon. Some Japanese players planned to report Kuro Games to the Consumer Affairs Agency department. Kuro responded by giving 160 Astrites (their in-game currency) as compensation. For context, 160 Astrites is worth 1 'pull', and the number of 'pulls' required to get the weapon guaranteed was 80 pulls. 

WuWa players were shocked and disappointed with Kuro, especially since Kuro didn't improve the confusing text despite feedback from both Closed Beta Tests.

   losing trust in players... Losing money and players at release is awful.

  forgive deception.

>  
>\> I'm genuinely curious as to how this even made it into production. Did no one in the   
  localization team, or the beta testers notice? That's their job 😭

After the backlash from JP players, Kuro decided to [issue individual refunds](https://x.com/hxg_diluc/status/1796218806328754295) to each player who tried getting the weapon, and told the affected players to fill in a form asking what kind of compensation they should receive, as well as their email. While r/WutheringWaves applauded the decision and [praised Kuro](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1d45vu9/regarding_that_mistranslation_on_jp_side_jp_has/) for doing the right thing, users in r/gachagaming were more sceptical of how Kuro would be able to refund each player since they were issuing refunds case-by-case and there were presumably thousands if not tens of thousands of players who had tried purchasing the weapon.

>\> Oh no…. Conditional compensation it seems.  
  Moreover, they literally ask how they should compensate.  
  Obscurity like this only leads to comparison of compensation down the line. I can’t see a   
  scenario where everyone is happy.

  Going 1 by 1 per email is infinitely more costly and time consuming than just implementing a   
  blanket change and something like a recall selector

   I'm curious though. Are they really going to investigate each case separately?  
>  
>\> This is good?  
   Does anyone know how the responses are?  
>  
>\> No it's not. It opens up Kuro for potential discrimination allegations if they give   
compensation   
to one person and deny another one with even the vaguest similarity in scenario. If they   
also  give varying kinds of compensation other than a full refund to everyone affecthat's   
also a potential discrimination allegation.

Fast forward to today, Kuro Games has now [leaked the emails](https://x.com/hxg_diluc/status/1796533273696628855) of the Japanese players who applied for compensation by mass replying to all of them without BCC. Additionally, it was later revealed that there was no compensation for JP players, and they were instead directed to [take it up with their payment platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1d4uyal/details_of_individual_handling_for_jp_weapon/?share_id=htPJhYR0kopovwMmvxbrE&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1). The ""individual compensation"" for the false advertisement did nothing for the affected JP players other than leaking their private information. Furthermore, this could lead to a potential lawsuit as private information in Japan is heavily protected.

r/WutheringWaves users are astonished and frustrated by the actions of Kuro Games, with some even claiming it was 'over' despite the game only being one week old.

**tl;dr:** Spoiled Creator accuses HoYoverse of suppressing WuWa by revoking his Creator Experience Server Access after he decided to cover Wuthering Waves.



**Summary:**

Recently, a content creator accused HoYoverse of anti-competitive practices during a livestream, leading to significant backlash. To support his claims, he shared his chat history with a HoYoverse contact. Let's break down what happened.

**The Chat History:**

1. The creator submitted his Boothill guide for review.
2. The HoYoverse contact asked if he planned to continue covering Wuthering Waves, given that he had covered previous betas.
3. He responded that he would be covering Wuthering Waves because, as a small creator, he didn’t want to be tied down to just HoYoverse content.
4. The HoYoverse contact replied that this was fine, but they would need to revoke his Creator Experience Server Early Access as it is limited to HoYoverse CCs. Not even all HoYoverse CCs have this privilege.

After that, the creator then became a bit aggressive, saying that this wasn’t a good business strategy for HoYoverse. The HoYoverse contact emphasizing the exclusivity of the early access privilege.

Trying to backtrack, the creator mentioned that Kuro Game (developer of WuWa) didn’t provide him much outside of sponsorship money. The HoYoverse contact reassured him that they understood and mentioned the possibility of future collaboration.

Interestingly, the HoYoverse contact even allowed him to release his early Boothill guide, acknowledging the effort he had already put into it.

  
And the funniest part of this:

Hoyoverse's feedback on the video was as following:  
The thief relic set was better and that substats should recommend speed as he doesn't need crit being a break focused character. Which he directly copied this into the comments section of his own video.

reddit_search_1hapa5g,Review of Wuthering Waves story ,"
It feels so good to finally feel like a true hero! In most gacha games I've played, the protagonists are mere spectators.  

Take  Tower of Fantasy or  Genshin Impact , for example: Aether, the protagonist with six elements, yet still utterly useless.  

I quit *m Genshin after Arlecchino humiliated him. Every fight is either someone saving him or him getting destroyed. That was my breaking point! I returned for the Natlan arc but stopped again after Capitano got humiliated. Seriously, imagine Thanos showing up to face the Avengers, getting beat down, and walking away empty-handed. How does that hype you up for the next arc?  

Now back to  Wuthering Waves. I tried it out of curiosity, and this game is everything I’ve ever wanted! I love everything about it: the story, the narration, and the characters. From version 1.0 to 1.4, I’m hooked, and I can’t wait for the 2.0 update, which seems like it will kick off a major arc and the *true* beginning.  

The Rover is such a fascinating character. Despite his memory loss, he retains all his qualities. He’s a leader who never remains passive: he proposes ideas, thinks before acting, does what he believes is right, and doesn’t hesitate to risk his life for others.  

Yes, it’s a cliché, but it’s done so well that it works perfectly! And the best part? He’s incredibly powerful. He can hold his own and delivers stylish, epic combat scenes.  

The scene where he saves Shorekeeper, with the music and that determined look in his eyes—IT WAS AMAZING.  

The Rover also has a tragic side: he’s someone who failed to stop the Lamentation but continues to fight tirelessly to save the world. It reminds me a bit of Viktor in *Arcane*. Not exactly the same, but in the sense of striving for solutions for a better world.  

And what about Shorekeeper’s story? I cried, honestly. She recognizes the Rover, but to him, she’s a stranger. Imagine the pain: finding your best friend again, but they don’t remember you. You’d be overjoyed to see them alive but heartbroken by their amnesia. That duality is so powerful.  

As for people calling it a ""harem"" seriously? Those who think that probably don’t talk to women much, or their perspective is skewed by bad faith. Think about the context: it makes sense for people to be attached to the Rover because they already knew him before! Jiyan fought alongside him years ago, Jinshi is connected to him through the Sentinel, and Changli knows him through her master. When someone has left such a mark on the life of someone dear to you, it’s only natural to want to meet them and guide them if they have a greater goal.  

And let’s not forget, we’re following *two versions* of the character who will have different paths:  

1. The ""old"" Rover, who failed, likely informed his friends of his future plans to ensure the younger Rover takes a different path and gains a better perspective. (This is still vague, but it’s a plot point that will surely be clarified later.)  

For Shorekeeper and Camelya, he’s their leader. So if one of them develops love or a deep connection, it’s perfectly normal it’s the result of relationships built years ago with the ""old"" Rover.  

That’s why, in Camelya’s story, the current Rover seems detached: for him, she’s a stranger. But it remains coherent and perfectly written.  

Wuthering Waves  is a masterpiece. I’m a huge fan of this game. The Rover—man, he’s so cool, I love him so much.  ",171,304,1733791410.0,WutheringWaves,Echo-X-Jynx,0.64,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1hapa5g/review_of_wuthering_waves_story/
reddit_search_1hz2op7,My LONG Wuthering Waves 2.0 Review as a Returning Player (mostly spoiler-free),"Before starting I would like to start with some context. I have quit gacha games a while ago, but upon watching the Wuthering Waves 2.0 trailers I decided to give it a go.

All gachas are predatory and cash grabs, however, ever since the release of Genshin, these games had to improve from cheap quality mobile games to games that can potentially keep up with actual JRPGs.

I played Wuthering Waves before during 1.0 and 1.1 but was heavily disappointed by not only the terrible performance but also the boring echo farming, slow progression and the slop exploration.

Prior to Wuthering Waves 2.0, I never felt like any of these gachas were actually good games and not a waste of time. However, I have changed my stance. Kuro Games has cracked the code and actually made is an incredible game, not an incredible gacha, an incredible game.

Before explaining my opinions point by point, I will start with a disclaimer: I will compare Wuthering Waves to Genshin Impact, because these two are the biggest competitors to one another, and I will also compare Wuthering Waves to my favourite open-world JRPG Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Comparisons to other games will also happen. I believe comparing is important so that the developers have an idea of what is good and what is bad when creating their game. If comparisons trigger you, stop reading now.

I played other gachas, such as Blue Archive, Tower of Fantasy, Honkai Star Rail, NIKKE, Fate Grand Order, Zenless Zone Zero, and I'm probably forgetting more, but I'll mostly keep comparisons to Genshin because the two are open-world.

I will be MOSTLY unbiased while writing my points.

**Exploration 9/10**

Kuro Games has cracked the code for gacha exploration. The exploration has been heavily improved on. The problem with open-world gacha games is that there's no real incentive to explore besides getting gems to pull in the gacha. Unlike a game like Elden Ring, where you can find chests that will give you a great new weapon to fight with, or weapon upgrading materials, gacha games have nothing of that, and this is by design. This design is flawed by the very concept of gacha games, in order to incentivize players to pull on the gacha. So I believed that making a good open-world gacha was impossible. However, Wuthering Waves proved me wrong. 

In Rinascita, with the ability to see where the puzzles are at, as well as the treasure spots and all that, I am not wasting 20 minutes with a gadget trying to find a chest for 5 Astrite. The usage of echoes such as the Inferno Rider that work as a mount to traverse the world faster, as well as not having to worry about stamina while running around the world were already good points WuWa had over Genshin, but Rinascita took it a step further by adding flying as well. 

There is a great variety in the amount of content in the over-world as well. A great balance between different puzzles and combat. And while some characters make exploration easier such as Shorekeeper, none of it feels truly character-locked. Unlike Genshin where the exploration is incredibly slow-paced and feels like a waste of time, and now Hoyo pretty much makes you have to pull the characters to have fun and speed up the process. I also hated in Genshin where I had to use Sayu to walk around faster, in WuWa, all characters have the same running and walking speed(if I'm mistaken then the difference is so small I haven't noticed whatsoever).

The only reason why I don't give it a 10/10 is because I still think Kuro can cook something to make the exploration even better. They should also give us the ability to fly in both Huanglong and The Black Shores, while also showing us just like in Rinascita where the chests are situated and all that jazz. I believe we all agree that going back to those regions after Rinascita just feels like a huge step down.

Also, letting us see where the passages underground are is absolute peak.

**Soundtrack 6.5/10**

I think the soundtrack in WuWa keeps improving, however besides few exceptions, I don't think the soundtrack is as memorable as some JRPGs or even some gachas. The OST in Genshin is a lot more memorable, or even PGR, a game by the same devs. Not to talk about JRPG games, Final Fantasy VII has a lot of great songs that everyone recognizes, same for the Xenoblade series(Counterattack, Desolation and A Step Away are absolute peak).

There's no soundtrack in WuWa in my playlist, there's no song in WuWa that's stuck in my head for a whole day. The OSTs are very generic, but I think it's still a step up from the songs in 1.0 and 1.1.

**Graphics/World Design 8.5/10**

This game is gorgeous. Sometimes I'm flying and I'm like ""damn this sky looks beautiful"". I also believe that Rinascita is just an improved version of Genshin's Fontaine. But the lack of settings to improve on the Anti Aliasing, as well as Unreal Engine randomly bugging textures does hold the game back. More on this on the next point.

While I really enjoy how the game and the world looks, I still feel like it can be improved on. The areas in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 are extremely creative and feel distinct from one another. Kuro is improving, I will let them cook, and I am sure this point will only keep improving.

**Performance 4/10**

Now I'm gonna CRASH OUT.

I have a mid PC. It doesn't stutter, it has 16 GB RAM after all! But the game still does not run great. It's definitely an Unreal Engine issue, but the fault doesn't fully lie on the engine. Kuro, my game is stuck running 2560x1440 on full screen because I have a great monitor. Why can't I decrease the resolution to make the game run better? And why does the performance feel the same on windowed even when I decrease the resolution by a lot? What's wrong with the code?

Why is Anti-aliasing just ""on"" or ""off""? No settings for SMAA or FXAA? The game looks pixelated. Also, Unreal Engine randomly bugs out textures sometimes, it breaks my immersion and makes the game look bad. And what do most of the settings even mean? What is Capsule AO? You should add a little question mark on each option so we know what these even are without having to google.

Genshin Impact runs extremely well. I understand it's a different engine, but they have the whole Render Resolution that heavily impacts your performance, which can be lowered or higher. Also more options for Anti-aliasing.

Even PS5 struggles with running WuWa, and there's no option to choose performance over quality unlike most games.

And it makes no sense that 120 FPS is locked behind better PCs. Even if you can't run your game at more than 60 on the overworld, there's a chance that you can run it at 120 inside a domain. Makes no sense to keep the setting locked.

Obviously the game runs better than on release, and the stutters are non existent as long as you have 16 GB RAM, but still. This needs to be improved massively. People are stuck playing Genshin Impact because their device can't run the game and no matter how much they lower their settings nothing changes.

**Voice Acting 6/10**

I will be talking about English VAs as that's what I play on. I have no idea about any of the other languages. I found the VAs to be incredibly hit or miss. Carlotta sounds great, so does Zani. Having different accents on the characters instead of the typical american accent that Hoyo always uses brings so much energy to the world and the game.

Something I love about Xenoblade is the different accents in the characters. The voice acting in the second game is not the greatest, the lip syncing is all messed up, but I still love welsh cat Nia. Xenoblade 1 Reyn is peak voice acting, and in XC3 everyone sounds mostly great.

I love WuWa from bringing diversity in the voice acting, but then you have Roccia whose voice doesn't fit her at all. Why is her voice so deep while she looks like a child? Phoebe's voice doesn't fit at all either. I also went back to finish the 1.1 story and Jué's voice was SO BAD, it sounded like they got a random 60 year old lady from the street and had her voice Jué.

I wasn't too harsh on my rating because 2.0 was a huge step up, and I know they even went back to fix voice lines before.

**Gacha System 8.5/10**

This point is one I'm not 100% confident about since I haven't played enough, but I think the devs have shown to be extremely generous. I have a F2P friend that played since 1.0 and has all characters and even some weapons. He's very lucky, sure, but I think the fact that he was able to get everyone for free is crazy.

Kuro has also given players free 5 stars before.

The rates being 0.8 instead of 0.6 may not feel like such a huge difference but it actually is. I've actually gotten some early 5 stars due to this.

Also, no 50/50 on the weapon banner actually compels me to want to pull on the weapon banner.

However, I think a lot of the 4 stars on this game are very mediocre. Both weapons and characters, besides a few exceptions, are just not good. Xiangling or Raiden(at least back when I played) worked very well with just a R5 Catch that you got from fishing. You don't need a single 5 star weapon or character to beat the content, while in WuWa I feel like there's a lot more need to get 5 stars.

**Endgame Content & Events 7.5/10**

I'm still UL54 so just like the previous point, I may have rated this too highly or too low. I think the Tower of Adversity is boring. I think the Spiral Abyss in Genshin and ToA are pretty much the same. 

I enjoyed that in Genshin you had 8 whole floors you had to get through in the beginning, because you really felt the progression you were making on your account. While in ToA you don't really have that. It definitely feels like you are definitely progressing a lot slower. And it doesn't matter how well you play, these are still DPS checks. There are also chambers in the Abyss where you aren't competing against the clock, instead you just have to protect that thing and keep it above 60% HP, which allowed a level of strategy in beating it even if you didn't have enough DPS.

However, I really like that in ToA you can share echoes and weapons. Your characters are also not locked in one side per se, instead using that energy system.

Some of the other endgame content(at least I would consider it) include the Holograms, which I actually quite enjoy. I think it still is a DPS check, I don't think it should have a timer, however, it doesn't matter how strong your account is, if you don't learn the patterns, you will have difficulty beating the later difficulties.

All events I played until now were great. I wish I could play previous events, if they were all permanent, that would be amazing, but unfortunately they aren't. Most events are combat related instead of some mickey mouse puzzles, and some are even co-op. 

The one permament event Somnium Labyrinth I'm not a fan of, though. The story is just too long. Who cares about the story in events? I personally don't.

**Combat 8/10**

I find the combat in WuWa quite great, although a bit confusing. I'm more of a casual player, so I don't like reading to see what the characters even do. In Genshin, I didn't even have to think. Most characters were so simple that I understood them after playing with them for a bit. But with WuWa I actually have to read and thinks about rotations and all that.

Honestly? I enjoy that, but at the same time, I'm quite lazy to learn. I think parrying is a cool system, having a dodge is incredible. Most characters are smooth to play with, and it doesn't feel like we need more weapon types because the devs have a lot of creativity with the way they design the characters. Sure, Carlotta has a pistol, but she pulls out a whole other gun on her ultimate.

But I also enjoy the creativity that the element system in Genshin had. Although I don't like Genshin's element system. I love the element system in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 however. But both these systems bring something more to the combat other than just the skills the characters have.

**Progression 5/10**

It's okay? I think echoes are definitely better than the artifact system in Genshin. You are able to farm echoes as much as you want. However, I still think getting echo EXP takes way too long. Maybe if you're a player since 1.0 you don't have this issue, but as a returning player I have it.

Also, upgrade mats being 60 stamina is just way too much, I think it should be 40. It takes too long to upgrade character levels.

And then you have the talents which are just way too many. Getting the mats for talents is not hard per se, and there's no locked days where you have to wait to farm them(unlike Genshin) however starting at a certain level you basically need the weekly materials for everything, and you're locked to farming those 3 times a week, which makes progression feel incredibly slow.

I feel like I'm always missing materials for everything, whether it is to level up the character, talents, or weapons. Progression feels quite slow, but I love that echo farming is a thing.

The dailies are also very easy to get through.

**Story & Characters 3/10**

Oh boy. I'm gonna include these together because I think a story cannot be good without good characters. I have so much to talk about this. I saw so many people praising 2.0's story as ""peak"", and I'm just confused as to why they would say that.

Let me preface this: I did not read Shorekeeper or Camellya's stories yet(which I saw people saying good things about), nor did I read any main story before 2.0(which I heard mixed things about). I watched a video summary instead. So my rating might've been either higher or lower depending on this.

I think Kuro has cracked the code for gacha. But they did not crack the code for gacha story yet. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe there's a single gacha that can keep up with the story of any real game or any JRPG. I heard good things about Heaven Burns Red and NIKKE, but I haven't read those, maybe they are exceptions.

I don't understand what's up with these gachas that focus so much on NPCs rather than the characters they're trying to sell us on.

As much as I dislike Genshin's story, I think Fontaine was peak gacha story. There was barely any NPC focus, and the NPCs that did have focus(Silver) were good. I even remember Silver's name because he was memorable enough for me to remember him. Why was Fontaine good? Because it had real character arcs throughout the story. I left Fontaine satisfied with the development of most characters: Furina, Lyney, Lynette, Neuvillette and Navia.

Not only that, these characters actually had a personality to them, especially Furina. I thought the whole mystery in Rinascita, the whole mystery plot between the families and all that was so incredibly boring. And it became so convoluted later on that I couldn't keep up with what the characters were saying. Rover was solving the whole mystery while I, the player, didn't even know what was going on after a certain point.

A real good JRPG has proper character arcs, and the main cast actually feels like they're there for a reason. Riddle me this, KURO GAMES: Why does Phoebe even exist? What does she accomplish? It's been 3 acts, and I feel like she could've been changed to a NPC and there would be no difference. I mean, you already used NPCs for so much, so...?

You're trying to sell me these 5 star characters, but all I got from Phoebe is that she has a cute face, and all I got from Zani is that she's overworked and has an italian accent.

Carlotta actually had a proper reason to be in the story because it was mostly focused on the Montelli and the Fisalia family, but that whole plot was so incredibly boring that what I cared most about Carlotta was not her character but actually how attractive she damn is.

Xenoblade Chronicles 2 in a mere 10 chapters develops EVERY SINGLE cast member, as well as the villains. The characters also have distinctive personalities, unlike Roccia for example. Roccia's problem is not only having an unfitting VA, she also has no personality. She is shown as shy, but then next moment she is talking to Rover like they've known each other for so long. She also talks in a boring monotone voice, doesn't stutter at all to show her shyness, and I learned basically nothing about her throughout the three arcs.

I understand it's difficult to develop every character because you're trying to sell them and it would become too convoluted, however I think this problem is easily fixed by having the characters be the focus and not the NPCs. Why do we not have a character on the Fisalia family, for example? It would make the whole plot between the two families more interesting.

As I said before, the characters in the story also had no reason to be there. Once again... just what is Phoebe's actual real purpose? In Xenoblade Chronicles 3(yes I love Xenoblade) it actually makes sense for the characters to stick together. Either because they are childhood friends, or they are in a journey to reach a certain place together. If Shorekeeper was with the Rover throughout the story of Rinascita for example, it would make sense. But instead, they're just focusing on introducing new characters, but not even making them enjoyable enough or have them play an important role in the story.

In all of Rinascita up until this point, I only kind of enjoyed Carlotta and Brant.

The villain was also incredibly boring. Phrolova appears once in Act I or II(I don't exactly recall) to say a single cryptic sentence and then doesn't appear again until Act III. The whole plots of the villains happen off-screen and instead they use and manipulate NPCs behind the scenes, and we never get their POV.

To not use Xenoblade as an example again... Final Fantasy VII Remake(I did not play the original) Sephiroth is an incredible villain. Every time he appears he feels like a real threat. We also get to learn more about his past and reasonings to do what he does, and he's overrall present throughout the whole game, even if for just a short while.

Here, the Fractsidus don't really feel like a real threat, Phrolova just said some cryptic stuff and was talking about a prophecy I didn't care about, and I felt like sleeping.

Kuro Games, you made us type a WHOLE survey that was basically a ""make your waifu/husbando"". I am hoping you can improve both the characters and the story.

The story is already a big improvement from the early chapters, so I have hopes you can crack the code on this as well.

**TL;DR and Overrall Enjoyment Rating 8/10**

I am sticking with Wuthering Waves because I have hope on the devs and I actually am having so much fun. I thought I was done with gacha but Wuthering Waves pulled me back in, not because I'm a gambling addict, but because it's a genuinely good and generous game. If they can improve the story and characters to keep up with real JRPGs/games quality, I am locked in forever.

Other issues like slow progression kind of stop being a real problem once you can clear everything on the game, so I'm fine with it because it still gives me a reason to come back to farm.

Performance needs to be heavily improved on.

Voice Acting has some weird direction and sometimes the voice doesn't really fit the character, however I like that characters have a distinct accent.

Soundtrack is decent, better than before but can still be better.

Dear Rovers,  


We would like to first express our sincere gratitude. Thank you for participating in and paying attention to our Closed Beta Test II. We received a lot of valuable feedback from all platforms. 

After careful consideration, we have finalized our plans for future adjustments and optimizations, and we would like to share them with you. 

We hope this Developer's Message addresses any questions you may have. Your continued support means the world to us.  


**A. COMBAT**

1. Overall Combat Experience Optimizations

We are addressing the issue of poor sound effects and hit feedback many of our players mentioned. We will focus on revamping the sound effects of weapon hit feedback, Echo Skills, Resonance Skills, and other battle aspects. In addition, we'll improve jumping by adjusting animation speed, camera transitions, and landing feedback to make it feel more natural.

2. Character-specific Combat Optimizations

We will be making specific adjustments for characters frequently mentioned in the feedback we received. 

Our current plans include:

① Adjust Lingyang and Jianxin's movesets for an elevated overall combat experience; 

② Adjust Verina's HP restoration mechanism so she can use her Photosynthesis Energy more efficiently;

③ Improve Calcharo's kit. His extra Intro Skill ""Necessary Means"" will be available by default.  


3. New Combat Skill Practicing Dungeons

We will introduce a series of new Combat Practicing dungeons where you can better familiarize yourself with each character's unique combat mechanisms, and practice how to combo.

Aside from the points above, we have also started working on other frequently reported issues, such as bad camera experiences, frequent lock-on loss, enemies quitting combat, and counterattack failures.  


**B. GAMEPLAY**

1. Echo System

We received a lot of feedback on the Echo system. Thank you so much for taking the time to test out this system and providing valuable suggestions! 

We have received many suggestions and concerns about how the Echo hunting experience was too grindy, how the game lacked disposal options for unwanted Echoes, and other issues.

To address these issues, we are planning to implement the following changes:  


① Make it easier to obtain various Echoes. 

We plan to make Echoes available through participating in-game events, completing daily activities, and other means.

② Provide a better way to dispose of unused or redundant Echoes.

You will be able to recycle unenhanced Echoes by converting them into random new Echoes of a type you have unlocked.

③ Return Turners when Tuned Echoes are consumed.

When you use Tuned Echoes to upgrade other Echoes, a designated % of Tuners you previously used will be returned.

④ Make it easier to get your desired Substats.

We will raise the minimum numbers you can get with substats rolling, and narrow the range of possible rolling results.

⑤ Optimize the auto-equip Echoes mechanism.

Additionally, we will improve Inferno Rider's Echo Skill to add a new transformation mode. When equipped, you can transform into the Infernal Rider. 

We will be developing even more new events and new gameplays centered around the Echoes, and improve them based on your feedback to create unique experiences.  


[ ](https://i.redd.it/hrhklo0m2vpc1.gif)

2. New Content for ""Depths of Illusive Realm""  


We will add a Tutorial Stage for ""Depths of Illusive Realm"" to help beginners better understand and enjoy this gameplay. 

More playable characters will be added in ""Deapths of Illusive Realms"". Additionally, you will also be able to use trial characters in this mode. Meanwhile, new high-difficulty events and special boss mechanisms will be added for you to challenge.

We are also working on other gameplay issues mentioned in your feedback. 

Here are a few examples: Drops from Supply Chests or enemies in the wild will be automatically picked up; Co-op mode will be available sooner, at a lower Union Level; A batch salvaging option for unwanted items in your backpack... We hope these changes can further improve your game experience.  


**C. STORY CUTSCENES & ANIMATIONS**

We are working on the frequently reported issues about story cutscenes & animations, including strange camera positionings, characters showing up at the wrong time, poorly matched lip animations, and lack of detail in story sound effects. Here are some of the progress we've made so far:

① Optimized the camera positioning and character animation in some parts of the story. Improved lip animation and eyeblink animation.

② Adjusted and rearranged the story quests’ progression for a smoother flow, and changed the unlock prerequisites for some story quests.

③ Reworked the sound effects in cutscenes for a better performance.

④ Improved the ""Skip"" function to make it work better.

We will keep polishing every detail of story cutscenes and animations to optimize the quality. We hope this will help you better enjoy the story quests.  


**D. OTHER OPTIMIZATIONS & ADJUSTMENTS**

Aside from the changes above, we are addressing game issues such as crashes, blank screens, frame drops, and device overheating. Improving game performance on all devices is a top priority. We're also improving the Character and Environment Designs and adjusting the UI for easier navigation. New events and story content are in early development and we'll share our progress with you.  


**E. LOCALIZATION**

We take localization quality very seriously, and it is also a big part of our future optimization plans. We will continuously improve the localization quality based on your feedback. We are working on adding EN/JP/KR voice-overs for stories and character voicelines. Thank you for your patience!

These are our future adjustments and optimizations based on the feedback we received during CBT II. These are our future adjustments and optimizations based on the feedback we received during CBT II. We apologize for any deficiencies or unsatisfactory content in the beta test build. The development team is committed to addressing these issues and prioritizing areas that were less enjoyable for players. Our goal is to bring you an even better version of Wuthering Waves next time.

# Who made this game?

[Kuro Games](https://www.kurogames.com/) (**headquartered in Guangzhou, China**.) is the game's developers and publishers. Previously they made a different gacha game by the name: Punishing Grey Raven (also known as PGR).

# What kind of Game is this?

https://preview.redd.it/x52ii5elpz1d1.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=1194a6cd41a4f1fc3fc7015f215f297bc36587aa

* It's a cross platform gacha game - A ~~waifu simulator~~ character collecting game
* A role playing adventure game with an open world setting/aspect
* Hack and slash game but with extra steps - we'll get to that later

# What's the story like?

Wuthering Waves is a story of resilience set in a vast, post-apocalyptic world. A cataclysmic event called the Lament ravaged the Earth, leaving behind a shattered civilization and unleashing monstrous creatures ~~(It's like Fallout but on steroids)~~. Humanity, however, has shown its indomitable spirit. Pockets of survivors have emerged, adapting to this new normal and rebuilding their lives with the aid of mysterious new technologies.

The narrative centers on the enigmatic Rover, who awakens from a long slumber with no memory of their past **(**[**He got Amnesia Yeah...**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5Xa0ACKaNo&t=0s&ab_channel=videogamedunkey)**)**. Driven by a sense of purpose and guided by whispers of a forgotten past, the Rover ventures into the unknown ~~(If I had amnesia and woke up in the middle of nowhere I would piss my pants)~~. Their journey is one of exploration, self-discovery, and perhaps even holding the key to unraveling the mysteries of the Lament.

Who was the Rover before? What caused the Lament? And what role will the Rover play in shaping the future of this fragile new world? These are just some of the questions that will intrigue you the player as you explore the depths of Wuthering Waves.

# How does combat work in Wuthering Waves?

Wuthering Waves boasts a dynamic combat system that combines fast-paced action with strategic team building. This guide delves into the core mechanics, empowering you to master the battlefield.

**Elemental Fury: Damage and Weapon Types**

Six distinct damage types define combat:

* **Aero (Wind):** Manipulating airflow like... The Last Airbender
* **Glacio (Ice):** Ice goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
* **Electro (Lightning):** Yinlin best waifu!
* **Fusion (Fire):** Fire!
* **Havoc (Dark):** Destroy\~
* **Spectro (Light):** Shiny much. Wow.

Complementing these elements are five weapon types:

* **Blades:** Large swords for sweeping attacks.
* **Swords:** Agile blades for precise strikes.
* **Pistols:** Long-range firearms for ranged dominance.
* **Gauntlets:** Brawling weapons for close-quarters combat.
* **Rectifiers:** Unique weapons with diverse functionalities.

**Basic Combat Actions**

Wuthering Waves offers a range of offensive and defensive maneuvers:

* **Standard Attacks:** Unleash a quick succession of strikes.
* **Heavy Attacks:** Charge your attack for a powerful blow (consumes stamina).
* **Midair Attacks:** Strike foes while airborne (consumes stamina).
* **Resonance Skills:** Activate your character's unique ability.
* **Dodge Counter:** Counter an enemy's attack with a well-timed dodge.
* **Resonance Liberation:** Unleash your character's ultimate attack.

**Forte Circuit**

The Forte Circuit defines a character's playstyle. Each character possesses a unique passive that enhances their combat capabilities.

**Strategic Swapping: Intro & Outro Skills**

Utilize Intro and Outro Skills for seamless team synergy. These skills activate upon switching characters, allowing for powerful combo opportunities.

**Unveiling Potential: Inherent Skills and Resonance Chains**

Inherent Skills are a character's passive abilities that provide constant benefits. Resonance Chains, the character skill tree, empowers you to enhance these skills and unlock new potential.

**Evasion and Parry: Mastering Defense**

Evasion allows you to dodge enemy attacks. Perfect dodges regenerate stamina, ensuring you remain agile. Parrying enemy attacks with precise timing stuns them, creating openings for counterattacks.

**Echoes: Gearing Up with Captured Essence**

Echoes are captured enemy essence that serves as your gear. You can acquire them by defeating enemies or farming specific stages. Each Echo has a rank, rarity, and cost, influencing its stats and equippability. The first Echo slot in your gearset becomes a usable skill, adding another layer of strategic customization. Gearsets offer two-piece and five-piece bonuses that enhance specific damage types or combat aspects.

# How does Echo Works in Wuthering Waves? (This is hard to explain)

https://preview.redd.it/zct7fbjkxz1d1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a641a4b31d080bb2e113091e376fd5b10eb3e19

In Wuthering Waves, character progression heavily relies on Echoes, just like equipment does in most gacha games. This guide dives into how the Echo system functions, its advantages and disadvantages, and how to manage your resources effectively to avoid future roadblocks.

**No Stamina Gating! But There's a Catch**

The good news? Unlike many games, acquiring Echoes isn't limited by stamina. You get them by defeating enemies in the Overworld, with a chance to snag their specific Echo upon defeat. This chance increases as your Data Bank levels up, reaching 20% at level 10. However, your Data Bank level also dictates the maximum Echo rank (rarity) you can find. We'll discuss that later.

**Echo Abilities and Attributes**

Each Echo boasts a unique ability that remains constant. For example, [Snip Snap](https://wutheringwaves.gg/echoes/snip-snap/) will always throw Firebolts. But Echoes also have attributes that determine their Sonata effect and, consequently, set bonuses. Additionally, every Echo possesses two main stats. While the first stat is random, the second depends on the Echo itself.

**Leveling and Upgrading**

Echoes can be leveled up, unlocking a new tuning slot every five levels. However, this doesn't apply to rank two Echoes, which are capped at level 10 and can't be tuned. Rank three and above can be tuned, gaining a random substat upon doing so. Rank five Echoes, maxed at level 25, can have up to five substats, which are random and fixed. This means you might end up with subpar substats or, if lucky, exceptional ones.

**Echo Freedom and Cost Load**

Resonators (the game's characters) can equip a maximum of five Echoes. The topmost slot determines the Echo ability, meaning you can only have one per character. The remaining four slots grant stats and set bonuses, which come in two and five-piece variations. This flexibility allows you to equip a powerful Echo ability while still achieving two-piece bonuses from the other slots. However, getting a perfect five-piece set with good substat rolls might be challenging and time-consuming in the final release.

Echoes also have a cost or load, and your maximum load increases with your Data Bank level (between 8 and 12).  The total cost of all equipped Echoes can't exceed this load limit. Using a higher-cost Echo might restrict your build options for that character.

**Ranks and Rarity**

Ranks, or rarities, determine an Echo's base stats. For example, my Sabertooth has two versions – one rank two and one rank three. Although they share the same main stats, the rank three version has higher stats.

**Upcoming Changes**

The good news is that farming for Echoes isn't limited by stamina. However, you're restricted by the number of enemies on the map each day and boss respawn timers. On the flip side, leveling your Echoes requires Echo development materials, which are indeed stamina-gated. This suggests prioritizing leveling an Echo to level five and tuning it once before maxing it out. If the first tuning roll results in bad stats, you'll at least save some XP materials.

As of now, there are only nine Sonata resonance types, limiting set building a bit. However, the developers are planning to implement changes based on player feedback:

* **Easier Echo Acquisition:** Expect to obtain Echoes through events, daily activities, and other means.
* **Echo Disposal:** You'll be able to recycle unenhanced Echoes into random new ones of unlocked types.
* **Tuner Return:** When using tuned Echoes for upgrades, a portion of the Tuners used will be returned.
* **Improved Substats:** Minimum substat rolls will increase, and the range of possible results will narrow.
* **Auto-Equip Optimization:**  The auto-equip function will be improved.

# What should I expect on day-1 and the loop!

[Day-1](https://preview.redd.it/r50s4h2r102d1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c0223f9e615ad5e2c93716961d5811c5a4dfe04)

**Getting Started:**

* The game starts with a short movement and combat tutorial. Don't worry if it feels overwhelming; there's more to combat explained elsewhere.
* After defeating the second guardian, you'll unlock exploration and chest-finding opportunities. These are great ways to acquire resources and learn the world.
* **Focus on the Main Story Quest:** It guides you through essential areas, unlocks features, and grants valuable Level EXP (your account level). Your account Level is crucial because it unlocks higher-level content stuffs.

**Really Basic Stuffs in Layman terms:**

* You start with Rover, your main character. Other characters (Resonators) are acquired through the gacha system ~~(duuuuuhhhhhhh).~~
* Echoes are gear (Read above).
* Throughout your journey, collect materials to upgrade your characters and weapons.

**The Dreaded Loop**

* **Follow the Main Story Quest:** This remains the best way to level up quickly and unlock new areas.
* **Complete Daily Quests:** These become available at Union Level 8 and offer easy rewards for a small daily investment of time.
* **Prioritize Side Quests:** Especially Exploration Quests, as they grant Union Level EXP and unlock new map sections.
* **Claim Free Resources:** Check the store's level-based bundles for free goodies, and utilize the free tier of the Battle Pass for additional resources.
* **Spend Your Daily Energy:** and slowly get FOMO and addiction with this game.
* Do End-game contents

# WHAT?? WHAT Are The END GAME CONTENTS??

https://preview.redd.it/26upxo0i302d1.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f550deeda164052900dfd05f9eef0519f161edf

There are three primary end game modes in Wuthering Waves:

1. **Tower of Adversity:** ~~Similar to the Abyss in Genshin Impact,~~ players progress through floors defeating enemies within a time limit. It's a mix of skill and character strength. Rewards include premium currency and character upgrade materials. This mode resets monthly.
2. **Tactical Hologram:** This is the most challenging mode, featuring boss fights with significantly enhanced versions of bosses encountered in the main game. Difficulty scales with rewards like character shards and premium currency. Mastering dodging and perfect gameplay is key. This mode offers repeatable challenges.
3. **Death of Elusive Realm (Depth of Elusive Realm):** ~~Inspired by Honkai Star Rail's Simulated Universe~~, players progress through stages collecting buffs that significantly power up their characters. This mode allows experimentation and lets players turn healers into powerful DPS characters. Rewards include passive buffs and upgrade materials. This mode seems to operate on a cycle and might offer character rotations in the future.

**General Tips:**

* Focus on building a strong main DPS character for most end game content. Please don't build ALL the characters you got. Build one team at a time. LISTEN TO THIS ADVICE!!
* Consider re-rolling for Verina for team synergy.
* Share weapons and Echoes between characters in Tower and Hologram modes. This is because each chamber is separate, allowing full HP/ult recovery and gear sharing.

# Wuthering Waves Team Building Guide?

**Understanding the Fundamentals:**

* **Resonators (Characters):** Your ~~waifus~~ characters, each with a unique element (Fire, Water, Wind, Spectral) and a set of skills: Intro, Outro (activated when switching in/out), and Concerto.  Build a team of 4 with complementary strengths.
* **Element Synergy:** Combining characters of different elements unlocks powerful **Concerto Effects**. These effects provide offensive or defensive buffs based on the element of the character you switch in and out of battle.
* **Resonator Roles:** Consider these key roles when building your team:
   * **Damage Dealer (DPS):** Focuses on high damage output.
   * **Damage Support:** Enhances your DPS's damage through buffs, debuffs, or elemental reactions.
   * **Sustain (Healer):** Provides healing for your team.
   * **Tank (Optional):** Draws enemy attacks, protecting your more fragile characters.

**Building Your Team:**

* **Balanced Approach (Early Game):** A well-rounded team typically consists of 1 DPS, 1 Damage Support, and 1 Sustain Resonator, all with different elements.
* **Advanced Strategies (Later Game):** Explore specialized teams like:
   * **Elemental Focus:** Maximize Concerto Effects by focusing heavily on one or two elements.
   * **Double DPS:** Utilize two strong DPS characters for maximum damage output (risky as it sacrifices defense).

**Free-to-Play Friendly Team (Early Game):**

[WuuuuWOOOOOOWWWW](https://preview.redd.it/1ysbrg3s702d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e088f4821859f88b2ff4c9cdbd7eeee91c12de26)

A strong F2P team with readily available characters looks like this:

* **Main Character (MC):** Flexible element, can be built as DPS or healer.
* **Yangyang:** Strong energy generation and potential sub-DPS.
* **Baizhi:** Free healer, valuable for early content.

**Team Building Considerations:**

* **Individual Skills:** Analyze a Resonator's skills (Intro, Outro, Concerto) for synergy with your team strategy.
* **Element:** Does the Resonator's element fit your desired team composition and Concerto Effect goals?
* **Cost:** Consider resource investment. Prioritize building your core team first.

**Additional Tips & Resources:**

* **Upgrade Resources Wisely:** Focus on upgrading your core team members before investing in others.
* **Experiment and Adapt:**  As you progress, adapt your team to conquer new challenges and suit your playstyle.
* **Team Composition Flexibility:** Don't be afraid to experiment with team compositions beyond the ""meta."" Play who you enjoy!
* **Synergy is Key:**  Focus on building teams where characters complement each other's skills (e.g., buffs, off-field damage).
* **Support Categories:**  Distinguishes between direct buffers (buffing the next character) and indirect buffers (buffing the entire team).

**Godlike Reroll Team or $$$ Team on Day-1**

A team designed around Yin Lin (DPS):

* **Team-member 1:** Calcharo (works well with Yin Lin).
* **Team-member 2:** Verina (great team buffer, but other options like Baiji exist).

reddit_search_1cyvmjj,My review of Wuthering Waves after 12 hours of gameplay,"TLDR: it's ok

So I just spent the last 12(ish) hours playing and wanted to share my sleepy thoughts on it's release. 

The good:
Combat: 
It feels great. It flows so well and the characters that I've tried all feel different and interesting. I like hoe you combo your characters together together and it feels like everyone can have a moment to shine in a fight. Another point I like is how enemies aren't sponges,  and even higher level enemies feel doable. I went up against a world boss 20 levels above me and managed to take it down with just my healer after my two dps characters were downed by it and it honestly didn't feel like a slog and was a fight I could do without wating an hour beating my head against him. 

Exploration:
The parkour makes exploration feel fast and fun with its wall running, it kind of reminds me of warframes parkour but slowed down. There's also a lot to do in the open world; puzzles, that aren't hard in the slightest if you care about that, boss hunting, and pokemon gathering. The echos (pokemon I just mentioned) are littered everywhere. The more unique ones you collect the higher chance you will get better quality echos. There are world bosses that are a set difficulty and can be fought whenever, there are also set bosses that scale to your world level that can farmed for stamina, or just fought for free if you really wanted to. 

The bad:
Performance:
I have a dated pc (1660 Super, 32gigs of ram, Raidon 9 processor and I don't remember the rest off the top of my head) and i was getting noticeable frame drops on medium. It was still playable, but it was definently there. Pop ins. Not just in one area, but all over. I will say though that it was smaller details and I didn't really notice anything big suddenly appearing, but it is jarring when it happens in the story, and in the same frame the camera is focusing on.

The story:
I get that it takes a while for things to start moving, and I get that it's best to start slow to ease people into the world and setting, but did they need to make it so long? The first few hours are nothing but exposition, banter, with a sprinkle of gameplay. It took hours after the tutorial section for me to be even remotely interested in the story, and then it hit me with a 'requires x level to continue'. I honestly wasn't expecting much for the beginning but it dragged on way to long for my taste.

The meh: 
Voice acting:
The EN actors range from alright to flat and uninteresting. Really a mesh mash of mediocre and bad. I've noticed a trend of these games were the initial acting is not up to snuff but later gets jumps in quality (I remember people complaining about Nikke, Snowbreak, and Reverse 1999s dub on release). Or people just get used to it and develop Stockholm syndrome I don't know.

Character designs:
The style from one character to another doesn't really change. Everyone has the same black and white with a splash of some other color mixed on. Even the clothes of some characters are very similar. It makes most of them just blend together. If it wasn't for the hair I think I would have trouble telling most of them apart.

Exploration:
It's good, but there's a part that I need to mention that bothers me. The grapple hook. The prompt to use it is very precise, to the point that if you don't know it's there you'll probably miss it. I say probably because there are different distances you can grapple to certain targets unless you chain them then you can grapple to another one from across the damn map it feels like. The grapple points are also kinda hard to see unless you're actually looking for them.

The world:
A large chunk of my time was spent in the wilderness beating up animals and monsters without many buildings or man made landmarks around. When I did come across some random town it was in perfect, or near perfect, condition as were the cities, and the military bases. I honestly forgot that I was in a post apocalypse setting. What's there looks nice, sure, but doesn't feel like its enough.

Closing thoughts: 
So I was invited into ZZZs cbt, but stopped playing a couple weeks ago to avoid burnout (I also submitted everything I could for feedback so all I was doing was daily grinding anyways). I liked the feel of the environment, the city scape, combat arenas, and characters all looked great, but hated how the combat felt like you were fighting tanks equipped with garden hoses. While WuWa has the opposite problem of not really having an identity, or fully realized setting, but has combat that feels great. All my time playing WuWa I couldn't help but think how their priorities were mixed up; ZZZ primarily relies on it's combat, but it feels frustrating to me while its art is top notch and very identifiable, but most of the gameplay is its combat. WuWa, on the other hand, should have prioritised a unique art direction that makes their open world RPG distinct from the competition, but I think their focus was mostly on gameplay feel (and rewriting). As it stands it's a mixed bag of the core gameplay is great, but everything around it could use some, or a lot, of work. Also yes I know needless hoyo comparison, but it was something i had in my head constantly so sue me. Now i just spent an hour writing this garbage so I'm going to sleep before my brain collapses onto itself.",528,62,1716478276.0,gachagaming,myspork1,0.91,https://reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1cyvmjj/my_review_of_wuthering_waves_after_12_hours_of/
reddit_search_1bfe1yj,A Review of Wuthering Waves CBT 2,"**PRELUDE**

As CBT2 nears its end, I feel the need to put my thoughts onto paper and leave my own rambling mess on a video game that hasn't even released yet. I am going to sound overall quite negative about the game but this is done from a place of love. I am actually very, incredibly excited about the game and would not have gone to such efforts to write this if I didn't care deeply. There's also going to be a lot of direct comparisons to Genshin but this is inevitable as Genshin is the basis which WuWa was made.

As a preface for those who care about gamer cred, I am Tacet level 40, databank level 19. I have cleared all of the permanent Tower of Adversity floors and have cleared some of the floors on the third page too. I have beaten all holograms up to difficulty IV and the only reason I didn't go further is because I am a medical resident working in the ICU and I really don't have the time to mald like that right now. I have completed all of the main story, all of the rogue like domains, and all of the parkour event. I have several world quests, character quests, and side quests completed, all without not skipping dialogue unless it was blatantly untranslated. In total, I think I have cleared about 80% of all the unique content the game has to offer.

I am primarily an RPG player with some forray into action RPGs. One of my first games was Morrowind...on the classic xbox. I have since played every bethesda release until Fallout 76, every deus ex game, every shadow run, every system shock, neverwinter nights, dragon age origins, divine divinity, original sin 1 and 2, most recently baldur's gate 3, and much much more. More importantly, I have played the games which served as the seminal influence for Kuro Games' development ethos: Nier Automata, Honkai 3rd, and Genshin Impact. 

I am also a veteran of gacha games. Considering I started with Girls Frontline on its global release, I probably started playing gacha earlier than most on even the gacha gaming subreddit. My gacha resume includes Arknights, HI3, PGR, Project snowbreak, ToF, Artery Gear, and, of course, Genshin Impact. Of these, Genshin has remained my mainstay - I full clear all limited events, am completely up to date on the story, and without fail have 36 starred every abyss since patch 1.3. 

All this to say, Kuro games made Wuthering Waves for me personally. I am the target demographic.


**COMBAT**

To put the best foot forward and the part Kuro games spent their most effort on, the combat of WuWa is certainly the most appealing part of the game. It's evident the devs spent a lot of effort to create many different enemies and movesets, characters with smooth, snappy, flashy animations, all blended together with the satisfying feeling of perfect dodges and parries. It's certainly no lie that the game feel is on the level of console action RPGs. And while it does not reach the heights of stuff like Bayonetta or DMC, it is at least on par with games like Nier Automata. My experience with PGR also tells me Kuro games knows how to make a good boss fight and I feel that quality has transferred over to Wuthering Waves. Calamity class enemies feel weighty and imposing. There is a fun back and forth dance to be had as you try to find openings in their aggression. Most bosses have decently telegraphed moves and few bullshit attacks/mechanics. Some exceptions are Mourning Aix's homing lasers and the big monkey's spin to win being attacks that the average player will realistically only learn how to dodge after being hit in the face a couple times. However, as good as the combat feels, Kuro didn't make a spectacle fighter, they made an open world RPG. Because of that, it is not sufficient to judge WuWa based on only its minute to minute gameplay.


**TEAMBUILDING**

One of the biggest disappointments I had from the transition of CBT 1 to CBT 2 is the wholesale removal of their elemental concerto system to a more ToF-like intro/outro skill system. The old concerto gave team buffs based on the element of the intro and outro unit. It had a universality that allowed most characters to have some degree of synergy with each other although certain units would benefit from certain element combos better. The effects themselves were rather plain with a lot being duplicates but that is a matter of needing refinement and not a good reason to scrap the system. Now synergies are much more rigid. Sanhua is your ice buffer. Taoqi is your skill buffer. Mordefi is your heavy attack buffer. Aalto is your aero buffer. DanJin is a havoc buffer for a havoc dps that doesn't exist yet. And the game suffers for it.

Concerto energy exists to encourage field time for all of your characters in a team. I think that is appropriate, considering quick swaps interferes with the spectacle fighter like combat style Kuro goes for. However, if you make a system that requires all characters to use field time, then all characters need to be able to deal damage or at least buff enough to justify field time. As things are right now, because of how intro/outro skill works it is very difficult to justify using much of the roster, especially for new players whose rosters are very limited. Characters like Sanhua or Aalto now simply do not contribute enough damage unless they are paired with an ice dps or aero dps, respectively.

If you've paid attention recently. A lot of CBT2 showcase videos are essentially ""DanJin solo hologram VI"". This may sound impressive but the catch is, when dps is on the line and you are fighting against the timer, it is easier to clear with solo Danjin than it is by playing her in a full team. This holds true for other characters too. I have equally invested into LinYin, YuanWu, YangYang, TaoQi, DanJin, Mortefi, BaiZhi, Rover and Encore. Unbuilt characters include Sanhua and Aalto. In my experience, it is better dps for me to on field Encore and only briefly swap to another unit to use encore's outro skill and then immediately swap back to encore. 

The Genshin equivalent would be every support being like Faruzan or Gorou. Imagine if Genshin didn't have Bennett, Yelan, Furina, Kazuha, Sucrose, the Viridicent venerer artifact set, and all the other relatively universal buffers. It would rightly be called terrible.


**MUSIC**

Music is a key part to immersion in an open world game. I'm going to make a hot take and say that it actually is more important than gameplay for an open world game. Take Skyrim as an example. Stripped to its studs, it is a mechanically easier game to play than even Genshin. Its also an RPG that had simplified its RPG mechanics to such a barebones state that people have constantly modded combat overhauls for the past decade to add complexity back into the game. Also, much of its story and characters, particularly in the main quest, are poorly written. Yet, Skyrim remains one of the best selling games of all time. A lot of this I can attribute to its music. The music has such a warm, inviting, yet grand sensation that compelled me to play a game which, in retrospect, I should not have enjoyed so much.

As for Wuwa, a game whose theme revolves around sound, I find it's OST to be mediocre. When listened to on its own I would describe most combat and overworld music as ""servicable"". When taken in its whole, I would describe it as ""surprisingly un-immersive"". As an example, the overworld music can be aptly described as muted rather than just calm. This goes in stark contrast with the heavy emphasis on base and percussion, along with the beeps and boops that plays during combat. If anyone in the beta wants to know what I mean, explore Desorock Highland for a minute and then go fight the Impermanence Heron. The two soundtracks are like from completely different games. It's actually jarring.

I'm going to start throwing out a lot of WuWa's ost, so I'll be referring to a youtube video by ""lord of chaos"" for futher reference but I won't link directly due to the risk of having my whole post deleted. Tracks 9, 16, 43, and 46 are typical examples of the overworld music. 26 is a piece I want to specifically compare to the [city ruins theme from Nier Automata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMw-DUnR10s) as I feel they both go for the same piercing, lonely, melancholic feel. Comparing the multilayered harmony from Nier only makes WuWa's plainess all the more evident. 

To put my thoughts in sum, Wuthering Waves is afraid of using a strong melody which makes a lot of the OST not leave a strong impression. Tracks 17, 27, 40 are good examples on how the music kind of all just blends together. They put heavy focus on the rhythmic percussion and bass but de-emphasize the melody. It makes every track feel the same way ""urgent and fast"" just as every overworld piece feels ""muted"". And when we do get to hear a melody it can be pretty uninspired, in particular the [main city theme track 42](https://youtu.be/LtlJNXaOC3c?si=VtMc_FMPpgCCZZkD&t=321) (apologies for the poor quality but this is the only video with the complete piece).

I'm going to use the Genshin soundtrack as the comparison. As mentioned, music is a key part to immersion in an open world game and so with WuWa and Genshin's open world being so similar, it is only fair to compare the two. Genshin has an incredible sound track that carries the mood of the environment very well. It is very melody forward and takes center stage when exploring the overworld. Also like Skyrim, Genshin has a warmth and invitingness to the ambient music that begs the player to stay for a while. Places like

[Enkanomiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdPItALzXnI) are just so memorable by their sound tracks alone. 

This is NOT just because of the fully orchestrated sound track. Here is a sample of Genshin's beta OSTs. These are MIDI files and so should be fully achievable by Wuthering waves and Vanguard sound

[Inazuma City Theme](https://youtu.be/zCUOpvfL5p0?si=xckVkzNL_4jtLn7h&t=611)

WuWa has some standout pieces, don't get me wrong. The first handful of tracks on the referred video are all bangers. Track 5 in particular is an example of what the main city theme should be and I am utterly confused why they don't use it instead. The problem is, I don't hear these songs often. I didn't realize half of them were even in the game until I started researching for the review.

**OPEN WORLD AND QUESTING**

The heart and soul of an open world game is its open world, is it not? WuWa's open world is quite similar to Genshin so there's not really much for me to say. The environments are beautiful and I do find myself staring at the scenery on occassion. It make exploring zones fun, although I wish they made character ascension material more common to find. Mobility is greater than Genshin but at the cost of decreased density in locations of interest. Its a trade off that is ultimately personal preference and so i won't make any judgements.

What I do have issue with is the integration of the open world into gameplay, more specifically the world quests. World quests are opportunities for the player to make an impact on the game world. And so fittingly they are the biggest chance for the game to make an impact on the player. Unfortunately, of the world quests I have done, I only have left with feelings of disappointment and unmet expectations. I left an earlier comment on the matter and will repeat it here: 

The Guixu city quest was the best that I played as it had unique mechanics, a cool boss fight, and a weird but not unwelcome motorbike subway surfer session in the end. Problem being, I've fought that boss probably 20 times already for ascension mats before starting the world quest. What they need to do is make the first time you step into the boss arena be the trigger for the start of the world quest. If people just want to get their ascension mats then they can just put a large disclaimer at the beginning saying ""you can skip the world quest to unlock to boss but we highly recommend against it""

The Dim Forest toxic spores world quest is probably the worst just because of how anti-climactic the ending was. Thematically and in some ways mechanically it is identical to the Genshin Sacred Sakura quest line. You travel around the map, doing puzzles at specific spots, and ultimately cleanse a very special tree. Except in Genshin the puzzle spots are only told to you as descriptions of locations and it is up to the player to search them out whereas WuWa boringly just gives you a quest marker to each spot. Genshin also has a very special, one time only boss fight at the end which require you to complete the same style of puzzle, except this time in the middle of combat. WuWa instead has two monkeys, neither of them were even boss mobs, at the end. Very disappointing. They should honestly just go full hog and copy Genshin wholesale and make you have to solve puzzles while a constant stream of enemies pour in. It would be great if you had to balance clearing out mobs while trying to solve the puzzle and being cautious to make sure your AoE doesn't disrupt the work you've made so far.


**STORY**

Much ink has been spilled about the story and personally I find the changes to the early game story to be fine. The world ended up being a lot less ""post apocalyptic"" than the fanbase expected and so I think the more light hearted and less edgy presentation is fitting. Citizens are complaining about inane things, there is no military conscription, couriers are reprimanded for going to dangerous zones rather than being forced to trek into danger. There is a distinct sense that the world is starting to heal. Civilization has not needed to fundamentally change to adapt to the disaster. This is opposed to Arknights, where the concept of a city was destroyed and now any large population must live on mobile platforms in order to survive. I've heard WuWa described as Futuristic Xian xia and I would have to agree.

That is not to say the story isn't without its flaws. The early story beats are full of new terminology, names, and places. We are just not given enough time to process all of the information. For global players the issue is compounded by the scuffed translation and the fact that many names are in romanized Chinese. For example, in the very first moments of the game, the guardian dragon is interchangeably referred to as a dragon and then by its chinese name ""Long"". I am partially fluent in Chinese. I know enough to at least be able to feed and shelter myself, call a taxi to the airport, and buy a airplane ticket back home. Despite this, I am unable to remember the name of the main city hub and even sometimes forget the names of characters that I own. 

By the time I got to Scar, I had lost so much investment in the story that I found his story book sequence to be unwelcome and hammy. It gave me the feeling of someone that was ""trying too hard"", if you get what I mean. Granted, this is still the early story and it likely will improve later on, so I won't belabor my point. Genshin's story was also boring early on and Skyrim's story just plain sucks so obviously story isn't a dealbreaker.


**ENDGAME AND ECHOS**

Will be brief, relatively at least. WuWa's endgame appears to be functionally similar to Genshin. The differences being WuWa has holograms and echo farming is not an exact one to one with artifacts. Personally I am not someone who needs a lot of end game content. I find the early and midgame experience to be much more important. To put into context, I have bounced off every MMORPG I have played. I have never ever made it to level cap, let alone started farming for end game equipment. Other than in Genshin, I suppose. So I'm probably not the best person to talk about what makes good endgame. But this should also make evident the kind of playerbase WuWa will be attracting. As I stated in the beginning, I AM the target demographic, like it or not. To me, WuWa endgame is essentially just echo farming. And oh boy do I have some problems with the echo system. It could probably be a post of its own but to put my thoughts on echo farming into summary: rate of acquisition is both too low and too time consuming, the RNG is even worse than Genshin, solo players get shafted too hard, not having off piece is cancer.


**SUMMARY**

I think the core foundation of the game is strong (combat and open world) but what is built on top of the foundation (the content) needs work. Most are things that can reasonably improve with additional polish, its just a matter of time and whether Kuro would rather start looking into the future and make more content rather than improve the content they already made. Certainly I would prefer the latter but my understanding of Kuro's financial situation is that they have landed into a bit of a Mihoyo situation where they have staked everything on WuWa becoming profitable. So chances are Kuro is likely going to release a flawed product and try to build improvements as they continue to develop the game, also not unlike Mihoyo.

We are probably too far in to development to make further major changes to the concerto system but its probably a personal preference anyways, so I'm just going to have to live with it. Ultimately, I am still going to play the game on release and, unless the Echo system remains completely unchanged and it burns me out of the game, will likely remain as a regular player.

Thank you for everyone who bothered to read all the way to the end.",417,85,1710509556.0,WutheringWaves,weaplwe,0.96,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1bfe1yj/a_review_of_wuthering_waves_cbt_2/

reddit_search_1i33nmd,Wuthering Waves Review as a Non-Gacha Player (played since launch),"Hey everyone,

I’ve been playing Wuthering Waves since day one, and as someone who doesn’t typically touch gacha games, I thought I’d share my perspective on the game. To be upfront, I’m not a fan of the gacha model and I dropped Genshin after just a few days, but Wuthering Waves had so much more going for it that I decided to give it a shot. Here’s a breakdown of my experience as a day one gacha-hater:

# What I Love:

**1. Character Design**  
The character designs are phenomenal. Every character feels distinct, and their abilities are beautifully animated and expressive. You can tell a character’s personality just by watching their ultimate animation. It’s a level of attention to detail that I deeply appreciate.

**2. Combat System**  
The combat is where Wuthering Waves shines brightest. It’s anime-meets-Souls-like, with satisfying dodges, parries, and smooth animations. The **Concerto System**, which lets you swap between characters to pull off combos and synergies, is an absolute joy. Every character I’ve played has been fun, yes, even Lingyang!

**3. Illusive Realm Event**  
The **Illusive Realm** deserves its own shoutout. It’s by far the most fun I’ve had in the game—more enjoyable than some actual roguelike games I’ve played. I wish it were permanent because I kept going back just for the pure fun of it, not for the rewards.

**4. World Design**  
The world is stunning; a perfect mix of anime aesthetics and highly detailed areas. It feels alive and lovingly crafted, and I’m excited to see how it expands.

**5. The Music**  
Despite many complaints that the music isn't ""that memorable"", I like it, though I don't understand why they removed the guitar part from the Crownless Theme, please give it back, it was so good. :(

**6. Mini-Games**  
Even though I don’t usually enjoy mobile-game puzzles, the mini-games here are genuinely fun. They’re a nice break from the main gameplay and rarely feel like filler.

**7. Gacha Model (Surprisingly)**  
While I’ll never be a fan of the gacha format, WuWa felt accessible. It’s not as in-your-face or predatory as some games, and the other elements of the game are strong enough to draw you in regardless. Not to mention that I got most characters without spending, and mostly just spend for weapons and Yinlin Sequences. 

# List of small complaints and QoL-features I'd love to see:

* **Option to disable slow-motion during dodges**: This would be especially helpful given that co-op events slow-motion is disabled anyway, and it would keep the flow of combat consistent when switching from single player to co-op.
* **More dodge animations**: Adding variety would make fights feel even cooler, especially since dodging is such a core mechanic. Right now every character has two animations for dodging; one for when you're idle and one for when you're moving. Since you barely just stay still during a fight I'd love if they just made these two animations play randomly instead and maybe even add one for variety.
* **Improved visual clarity for boss attacks**: Some bosses’ moves get lost in the flashiness of the animations. Even something as simple as a Sekiro-Style perilous warning for high damage attacks could help avoid frustration.
* **Smoother movement**: I love that you can do the slow menacing walk like in Sekiro, as it makes fights so much cooler, but the running kinda feels sluggish to me. A slight speed boost or smoother transition between the dash and the run would be nice, since right now you do this fast dash only to end up slightly faster than the jog, which I also think could be made a little faster.

# What I Actively Dislike:

Before I come to the next list of negatives I want to clarify some things before I get spammed with the same messages over and over again. I'm about to critique some aspects that are pretty common in other Gacha Games as well, but I don't think that shutting down every critique that challenges the game to do more with itself besides being another Gacha-slop like Genshin etc. is a good idea. To me the definition of a Gacha is a game where you pull for characters and weapons for said characters using limited currency that you get by paying money or logging in daily and doing quests that are limited. And while I certainly would prefer just having a normal open-world game where I can get every Character legit and level them without time-gate or spending money, I understand that this is their business model and they probably won't change that, which I am also not asking for.

**1. Boss Design & Artificial Difficulty**  
I can’t stand time-gated boss fights or bullet-sponge enemies. It feels like artificial difficulty, especially when dodging and countering don’t feel rewarding enough. Right now a perfect dodge slows down the time, but not the timer, which is really stupid. The best way to clear in time is to just spam your rotation, ignore damage and heal it before doing it again. Dodge-counters should deal significantly more stagger damage to create better openings, rewarding thoughtful and defensive game-play over button-mashing and hoping the boss doesn't interrupt your important attacks.

**2. Lack of Long-Term Content**  
Once you’ve done the story and events, it feels like there’s not much left to do. Limited events like Holograms are fun but too infrequent to keep me engaged long-term. Most quests boil down to repetitive enemy mobs with little variety in design or mechanics. No new move-sets, no new enemies or designs for enemies, just a different arrangement of them, that's it. The only combat event I enjoyed so far is the Illusive Realm like mentioned earlier, it was the only one where I had motivation to play it beyond just getting my Astrides. 

**3. Story Weaknesses**  
The story started strong but has fallen off for me. The first Act was so amazing and I loved the story and the tone set. Not only did the story made me interested in the world and the characters, it actually had a good fucking climax each time. First the fight against Scar, which was amazing, then the whole Story with Jiyan where you fought Dreamless at the end and unlocked your Havoc MC was SO GOOD. I actually forgot I was playing a Gacha Game at this point. But sadly the character stories that came after that were a bit of let down.   
  
Yinlin had a nice story and I loved the whole puppet thing, as it made for a really good setting, and made me genuinely excited about what's to come, and the thing is, if I didn't already made the population of the Mech Abomination go extinct in order to farm the 4-Cost and the mats to level my Yinlin, it probably would've made for a decent climax as this thing looks scary as fuck. But it would've been even better if they just made us fight the Puppet Master that was the big bad of the story too, I was really sad given how much I loved the Scar fight. just give him 4-5 moves, make him summon some TD's to support him and done, a good climax to the story instead of what we got.   
  
After that I started skipping more often as I felt like most stories would just lead to a boss fight with another loot-box I already dropped hundreds of times at this point. And after the introduction of ""Abby"" I pretty much just started spam clicking the top left corner of my screen every story that came after her. It may not be as bad as Paimon, but why even add a Paimon clone in the first place knowing damn well how much the Genshin Community ""loves"" Paimon. I just wish the story felt like it had actual stakes again and gave me a bit of the post-apocalyptic feeling back.

**4. Echo/Artifact System**  
The Echo system is probably my biggest disappointment in WuWa. When I first saw the gameplay, I was genuinely excited about its potential as a creature-collecting mechanic, especially since I’d just came from the Palworld hype train. I thought that if I can’t pull the characters I want, at least I can at least catch myself a cool set of Echoes. It felt like WuWa was set to carve out its own identity with this feature, offering something unique compared to other gacha games.

Unfortunately, the Echo system turned out to be much closer to the artifact grind in Genshin Impact and other gacha slop, and that realization was a massive letdown. Despite this, I held onto hope as updates like the Data Bank system made farming slightly less painful. But they stopped improving anything with the new levels and the system feels like a wasted opportunity.

You can't tell me that Echoes like the Dreamless, Fallacy of no Return, Jué, the Ape, or even weaker Echoes like the Havoc Dreadmane, Cyan-Feathered Heron, the big fucking Ice Sword or even the summonable Echoes aren't incredibly cool concepts and sometimes just as fun to use as the skill of the equipped Resonator. Their designs and abilities are flashy, fun, and visually stunning. Why not take it further? Imagine if we could cycle them mid-combat, using the Ape for the big enemies and single-target situations, using the Cyan Feathered Heron to counter special attacks like the Crownless combo, or using a Whiff Whaff for clearing mobs with the Aero-Set for example. Balancing could be as simple as shared cooldowns, but it would breathe life into Echoes as more than just stat sticks.

The most fun I've had was when I started the game, didn't have my full Data Bank and kept trying out the new abilities of the Echoes. Most of the time I used the Havoc Dreadmane for my Rover despite it being sub-optimal, just because I felt like it fit and was fun to use. Even now I try to make weaker Echoes work just because I like using them. But the joy of experimenting is just kinda gone given how cost expensive it is to even level up an Echo in the first place.

Another opportunity that they kinda ruined in my opinion is upgrading the abilities of the Echoes themselves, like the current Nightmare Echo system, which was underwhelming as it replaced the original rather than building on it. Adding a mechanic for Echoes to evolve or unlock new abilities could turn them into a true progression system instead of a tedious grind. (Just like they did in Illusive Realm, though I do understand that doing this for every single Echo would take a huge amount of time, but they could even just add simple buffs that probably aren't that hard to implement (especially since they already used some of them) like making the pull area of the Whiff Whaff bigger, giving it more pull strength, or giving the Glacio Prism bonus damage against frozen targets, increasing the summon duration similar to how they level up in the current co-op system) and if they don't already have a blue-print for that just let them deal more damage per level or give your Resonator extra sets like +10 ATK or decreasing the cooldown of the skill. ANYTHING, it's not that hard to come up with stuff.

What hurts the most is that this could have been the game’s standout feature, setting it apart from Genshin and drawing in players who love creature-collecting games or meaningful progression systems. Instead, the current implementation feels like a step backward—a system with so much potential reduced to an artifact grind. For players like me who came in hoping for something fresh, this feels like a missed opportunity to make the game actually unique. And to add insult to injury the Artifact grind is atrocious as well.

What frustrates me most is how every suggestion to improve the Echo system gets dismissed with, ""it's a gacha, not a creature collector,"" or other dry arguments from people who wouldn’t even be affected by the change. It wouldn’t make WuWa a different game—you can still pull for your Waifus—while players like me could actually enjoy the game beyond the monthly Hologram fight. Ignoring the fact that *Pokémon* to this day is still the most poplar franchise with an easy concept of just add a few more monsters and maybe buff and evolve some of the older ones to keep the players happy and that WuWa has the literal blueprint to do is kinda oblivious to me.

Final Thoughts:  
Wuthering Waves is still a great game, and I’m glad I gave it a chance. But I currently feel like the game is kinda letting me down, which is sad since I already spend money as I trusted them to keep expanding on their ideas and listen to players like us as well. I still hope for the best for this game and Kuro, as it's evident that they do care about their players, just sadly not much about the non-gacha players, which does make sense, but even so they could still make money by drawing in new players.

reddit_search_1gsf19d,The community of wuthering waves,"This is unrelated to husbandos directly but is in regard to some of the comments who comment under posts and just start accusing everyone saying anything negative as ""hoyoshills."" It made me wonder, when the game started, didn't people start playing because players didn't want a ""white knight"" community like genshin? All I see nowadays in main sub and sometimes the lurkers in this sub too is that the moment you express any dissatisfaction(mostly in main sub not here), you either get called a hoyoshill or get banned. Atleast the white knights of genshin have paragraphs ready to defend their game, these people's only argument is ""hoyoshill."" Bruh. 

I feel like this narrative for this game would have never been there if Kuro had chosen some better content creators instead of drama baiters to advertise their game initially, and whoever did the initial beta tests had given better reviews for the game, instead of making it more ""genshin like"" as people like to say. The ""genshin killer"" narrative done by some content creators were directly responsibe for what we have as a community now, even more extreme white knights.

reddit_search_1d1d2ek,A Perspective Into How DISASTROUSLY WW Was Received in China that Prompted The Compensation,"Any sane person should at least admit that WW has had a disastrous launch. Even if your experience is fluid, it is not representative of tens of thousands of people having stuttering/lag issues (like me). Well, just how bad can it get? We all know that CN Genshin players are now mass exiting WW and returning to Genshin, basically turning the comment section of their official account into a confessional (currently sitting at an astonishing [54k](https://www.bilibili.com/opus/934207145588555810) comments. But what's the situation elsewhere? Oh we are in for a ride

A simple search of WW right now on Bilibili (Chinese Youtube) yields a dazzling amount of videos pointing out various problems with almost every aspect of WW. Most of them are gaining hundreds of thousands even million of views. This is surprising since it's only been a few days after the initial launch. Without certain CCs acting as a filter for critical opinions, CN players are relentless in their dissing of the WW fiasco. I will divide these videos into several subcategories, pick a few of the most influential videos, present the stats, and talk about the gist of their ideas. You can check out the link and see the general sentiments of the CN players in the comments.

# 1. The Confessional and Genshin/WW Comparison Videos

This type of videos mostly compares the two games from the overall experience down to the animation of climbing up the floors to express their disappointment in Kuro's lack of attention to details and reevaluates their view on Genshin. ""The meaning of your journey"" refers to what Dainsleif said in the Travail trailer and what Venti said at the end of Mond archon quest. For example:

# 2. Critiquing the subpar plot of WW

And I don't just mean the beginning. CN players do not like ANY of the plot, spanning the entirety of the main story and Jiyan story quest. One of the major things they were discontent with was how Jiyan and Geshu Lin were depicted in the main story and Battle underneath the Crescent cinematics. In their eyes, Jiyan fled the battlefield when his superior Geshu Lin issued the command to stay in the frontline, and he is thereby called the ""Deserter General"" (And some used Jing Yuan's ultimate line to make fun of Jiyan, saying ""Time for the master desertation!"" Funniest shit I've ever read) [There were actually already a significant portion of players who were dissatisfied with the plot under the official cinematics before the launch.](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ri421D7Xd) This is a screenshot of Chinese players spamming ""?"" on the official cinematics.

Later, Jiyan put the military's commands in rover's hands as if rover were not an amnestic being but somehow an experienced combat general, prompting the community to doubt Jiyan's military prowess and decisions.

Another one is how Jianxin treats the group of people who destroyed military radar. People are expecting her and Yangyang (who is associated with the military) to bring them to justice, while they just let criminals walk free. I could list more, like Lingyang's story, Scar, etc., but you get the idea. Here are a few:

A lot of streamers who play the game (outside sponsored streamers of course) were so extremely disappointed that they just broke down going through WW. Their reactions were recorded and touted as comedies to enjoy. CN players came up with the name ""shit-eating watchparty"" for these kinds of videos.

5. Analyzing the revenue WW is making

WW's launch only placed it at around 10th place max on the revenue ranking chart for the mobile apps in China while constantly dropping, which is painfully mediocre as even ToF's launch placed it at around 3-4th for a few days, not to mention that game like Star Rail occupied the top place for 3-4 days straight during launch.

It should be noted that I only picked a few, but there are plenty other videos at around 400k - 900k up to 1M views criticizing every aspect of the game. ( And they are constantly increasing in views. Just go to the vids and check the differences between the one I documented and their current state. The views are going up so fast)

Even after they gave out a free standard 5 star selector, they are still getting roasted relentlessly in their comment section at this very moment, demanding them to switch up their writers and optimize stuttering. [The newest one](https://t.bilibili.com/935815108288839731?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0) has 17k comments already. Ironically, the common sentiment is that ""Kuro didn't listen"" and that they are playing dead.

Funnily enough, there are already rumors that Kuro has changed some in-game lines and designs based on CN player's feedback. For example, a line that Yangyang said that was deemed disrespectful towards soldiers is removed. And it seems that Scar's design is altered because CN players are sick of his cock-zipper for some reason.

reddit_search_1k8lumc,1 Year Review [Wuthering Waves Bookkeeping],"Hello guys, with the anniversary patch coming closer I figured some may be interested in some numbers for the first year of Wuthering Waves.

First off, here's the doc link [WW Bookkeeping](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1msSsnWBcXKniykf4rWQCEdk2IQuB9JHy/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=104109225578827433327&rtpof=true&sd=true).

I'm collecting the data from the announcements or estimate them by similar past events and mark them off as unreliable (yellow background) until the actual event itself is out in the game itself and I then write the numbers down as confirmed. I don't collect any stuff until I wrote the amounts down, so it should be very close to the actual amount. So far the biggest variation from earliest estimate was 2.2 with the livestream compensation, otherwise it was within 7~ pulls.

Now to some numbers:

* In the first year, we got a total of 1046 pulls and 15 limited resonators. That's 69,8 pulls per limited resonator. If you want to exclude Xiangli Yao because he was given away for free, we got a total of 74,7 pulls per limited resonator.

* We got 87 weapon pulls, meaning one guaranteed signature by now.

* We got 365 standard pulls (heh, what a funny number. One standard pull per day.)

* We get 109,9 limited pulls (Astrites, resonator pulls and weapon pulls) per patch on average excluding 1.0.

* The record being obviously 1.0 with 254 pulls, followed by 2.0 with 151 pulls. Third place is 1.1 with 120 pulls, closely followed by 2.3 (so far) with 117 pulls.

* That comes down to 18 pulls per week on average. The record holders here are 1.0 (49,4 pulls per week) again, followed by 2.0 (25 pulls p.W.). Third place belongs to 2.2 interestingly enough with 23 pulls per week.

For the paying players the numbers are a bit different:

* They got 1431 pulls in the first year. That's subscription + battlepass. That comes down to 143 pulls per patch on average.

* Paying players get 22 pulls per week.

Since I'm crazy I also wrote down the credits and resonator and weapon exp: 

* Record holder for most credits given away via dailies and events was  1.0 with 10.7 million again. 2.0 was surprisingly close behind tho with 10.2 million. The average here per patch is 6.3 million. That's enough to  cover your needs for 2 new resonators per patch!

So how was your first year with WuWa, did you get your wanted resonators or did you have to pinch or outright massacre your wallet? 

As usual, if you do have any questions, feel free to ask away. If you see any mistakes, please send a message or leave a comment, so I can correct it asap!

reddit_search_1hz2o6d,My LONG Wuthering Waves 2.0 Review as a Returning Player (mostly spoiler-free),"Before starting I would like to start with some context. I have quit gacha games a while ago, but upon watching the Wuthering Waves 2.0 trailers I decided to give it a go.

All gachas are predatory and cash grabs, however, ever since the release of Genshin, these games had to improve from cheap quality mobile games to games that can potentially keep up with actual JRPGs.

I played Wuthering Waves before during 1.0 and 1.1 but was heavily disappointed by not only the terrible performance but also the boring echo farming, slow progression and the slop exploration.

Prior to Wuthering Waves 2.0, I never felt like any of these gachas were actually good games and not a waste of time. However, I have changed my stance. Kuro Games has cracked the code and actually made is an incredible game, not an incredible gacha, an incredible game.

Before explaining my opinions point by point, I will start with a disclaimer: I will compare Wuthering Waves to Genshin Impact, because these two are the biggest competitors to one another, and I will also compare Wuthering Waves to my favourite open-world JRPG Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Comparisons to other games will also happen. I believe comparing is important so that the developers have an idea of what is good and what is bad when creating their game. If comparisons trigger you, stop reading now.

I played other gachas, such as Blue Archive, Tower of Fantasy, Honkai Star Rail, NIKKE, Fate Grand Order, Zenless Zone Zero, and I'm probably forgetting more, but I'll mostly keep comparisons to Genshin because the two are open-world.

I will be MOSTLY unbiased while writing my points.

**Exploration 9/10**

Kuro Games has cracked the code for gacha exploration. The exploration has been heavily improved on. The problem with open-world gacha games is that there's no real incentive to explore besides getting gems to pull in the gacha. Unlike a game like Elden Ring, where you can find chests that will give you a great new weapon to fight with, or weapon upgrading materials, gacha games have nothing of that, and this is by design. This design is flawed by the very concept of gacha games, in order to incentivize players to pull on the gacha. So I believed that making a good open-world gacha was impossible. However, Wuthering Waves proved me wrong.

In Rinascita, with the ability to see where the puzzles are at, as well as the treasure spots and all that, I am not wasting 20 minutes with a gadget trying to find a chest for 5 Astrite. The usage of echoes such as the Inferno Rider that work as a mount to traverse the world faster, as well as not having to worry about stamina while running around the world were already good points WuWa had over Genshin, but Rinascita took it a step further by adding flying as well.

There is a great variety in the amount of content in the over-world as well. A great balance between different puzzles and combat. And while some characters make exploration easier such as Shorekeeper, none of it feels truly character-locked. Unlike Genshin where the exploration is incredibly slow-paced and feels like a waste of time, and now Hoyo pretty much makes you have to pull the characters to have fun and speed up the process. I also hated in Genshin where I had to use Sayu to walk around faster, in WuWa, all characters have the same running and walking speed(if I'm mistaken then the difference is so small I haven't noticed whatsoever).

The only reason why I don't give it a 10/10 is because I still think Kuro can cook something to make the exploration even better. They should also give us the ability to fly in both Huanglong and The Black Shores, while also showing us just like in Rinascita where the chests are situated and all that jazz. I believe we all agree that going back to those regions after Rinascita just feels like a huge step down.

Also, letting us see where the passages underground are is absolute peak.

**Soundtrack 6.5/10**

I think the soundtrack in WuWa keeps improving, however besides few exceptions, I don't think the soundtrack is as memorable as some JRPGs or even some gachas. The OST in Genshin is a lot more memorable, or even PGR, a game by the same devs. Not to talk about JRPG games, Final Fantasy VII has a lot of great songs that everyone recognizes, same for the Xenoblade series(Counterattack, Desolation and A Step Away are absolute peak).

There's no soundtrack in WuWa in my playlist, there's no song in WuWa that's stuck in my head for a whole day. The OSTs are very generic, but I think it's still a step up from the songs in 1.0 and 1.1.

**Graphics/World Design 8.5/10**

This game is gorgeous. Sometimes I'm flying and I'm like ""damn this sky looks beautiful"". I also believe that Rinascita is just an improved version of Genshin's Fontaine. But the lack of settings to improve on the Anti Aliasing, as well as Unreal Engine randomly bugging textures does hold the game back. More on this on the next point.

While I really enjoy how the game and the world looks, I still feel like it can be improved on. The areas in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 are extremely creative and feel distinct from one another. Kuro is improving, I will let them cook, and I am sure this point will only keep improving.

**Performance 4/10**

Now I'm gonna CRASH OUT.

I have a mid PC. It doesn't stutter, it has 16 GB RAM after all! But the game still does not run great. It's definitely an Unreal Engine issue, but the fault doesn't fully lie on the engine. Kuro, my game is stuck running 2560x1440 on full screen because I have a great monitor. Why can't I decrease the resolution to make the game run better? And why does the performance feel the same on windowed even when I decrease the resolution by a lot? What's wrong with the code?

Why is Anti-aliasing just ""on"" or ""off""? No settings for SMAA or FXAA? The game looks pixelated. Also, Unreal Engine randomly bugs out textures sometimes, it breaks my immersion and makes the game look bad. And what do most of the settings even mean? What is Capsule AO? You should add a little question mark on each option so we know what these even are without having to google.

Genshin Impact runs extremely well. I understand it's a different engine, but they have the whole Render Resolution that heavily impacts your performance, which can be lowered or higher. Also more options for Anti-aliasing.

Even PS5 struggles with running WuWa, and there's no option to choose performance over quality unlike most games.

And it makes no sense that 120 FPS is locked behind better PCs. Even if you can't run your game at more than 60 on the overworld, there's a chance that you can run it at 120 inside a domain. Makes no sense to keep the setting locked.

Obviously the game runs better than on release, and the stutters are non existent as long as you have 16 GB RAM, but still. This needs to be improved massively. People are stuck playing Genshin Impact because their device can't run the game and no matter how much they lower their settings nothing changes.

**Voice Acting 6/10**

I will be talking about English VAs as that's what I play on. I have no idea about any of the other languages. I found the VAs to be incredibly hit or miss. Carlotta sounds great, so does Zani. Having different accents on the characters instead of the typical american accent that Hoyo always uses brings so much energy to the world and the game.

Something I love about Xenoblade is the different accents in the characters. The voice acting in the second game is not the greatest, the lip syncing is all messed up, but I still love welsh cat Nia. Xenoblade 1 Reyn is peak voice acting, and in XC3 everyone sounds mostly great.

I love WuWa from bringing diversity in the voice acting, but then you have Roccia whose voice doesn't fit her at all. Why is her voice so deep while she looks like a child? Phoebe's voice doesn't fit at all either. I also went back to finish the 1.1 story and Jué's voice was SO BAD, it sounded like they got a random 60 year old lady from the street and had her voice Jué.

I wasn't too harsh on my rating because 2.0 was a huge step up, and I know they even went back to fix voice lines before.

**Gacha System 8.5/10**

This point is one I'm not 100% confident about since I haven't played enough, but I think the devs have shown to be extremely generous. I have a F2P friend that played since 1.0 and has all characters and even some weapons. He's very lucky, sure, but I think the fact that he was able to get everyone for free is crazy.

Kuro has also given players free 5 stars before.

The rates being 0.8 instead of 0.6 may not feel like such a huge difference but it actually is. I've actually gotten some early 5 stars due to this.

Also, no 50/50 on the weapon banner actually compels me to want to pull on the weapon banner.

However, I think a lot of the 4 stars on this game are very mediocre. Both weapons and characters, besides a few exceptions, are just not good. Xiangling or Raiden(at least back when I played) worked very well with just a R5 Catch that you got from fishing. You don't need a single 5 star weapon or character to beat the content, while in WuWa I feel like there's a lot more need to get 5 stars.

**Endgame Content & Events 7.5/10**

I'm still UL54 so just like the previous point, I may have rated this too highly or too low. I think the Tower of Adversity is boring. I think the Spiral Abyss in Genshin and ToA are pretty much the same.

I enjoyed that in Genshin you had 8 whole floors you had to get through in the beginning, because you really felt the progression you were making on your account. While in ToA you don't really have that. It definitely feels like you are definitely progressing a lot slower. And it doesn't matter how well you play, these are still DPS checks. There are also chambers in the Abyss where you aren't competing against the clock, instead you just have to protect that thing and keep it above 60% HP, which allowed a level of strategy in beating it even if you didn't have enough DPS.

However, I really like that in ToA you can share echoes and weapons. Your characters are also not locked in one side per se, instead using that energy system.

Some of the other endgame content(at least I would consider it) include the Holograms, which I actually quite enjoy. I think it still is a DPS check, I don't think it should have a timer, however, it doesn't matter how strong your account is, if you don't learn the patterns, you will have difficulty beating the later difficulties.

All events I played until now were great. I wish I could play previous events, if they were all permanent, that would be amazing, but unfortunately they aren't. Most events are combat related instead of some mickey mouse puzzles, and some are even co-op.

The one permament event Somnium Labyrinth I'm not a fan of, though. The story is just too long. Who cares about the story in events? I personally don't.

**Combat 8/10**

I find the combat in WuWa quite great, although a bit confusing. I'm more of a casual player, so I don't like reading to see what the characters even do. In Genshin, I didn't even have to think. Most characters were so simple that I understood them after playing with them for a bit. But with WuWa I actually have to read and thinks about rotations and all that.

Honestly? I enjoy that, but at the same time, I'm quite lazy to learn. I think parrying is a cool system, having a dodge is incredible. Most characters are smooth to play with, and it doesn't feel like we need more weapon types because the devs have a lot of creativity with the way they design the characters. Sure, Carlotta has a pistol, but she pulls out a whole other gun on her ultimate.

But I also enjoy the creativity that the element system in Genshin had. Although I don't like Genshin's element system. I love the element system in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 however. But both these systems bring something more to the combat other than just the skills the characters have.

**Progression 5/10**

It's okay? I think echoes are definitely better than the artifact system in Genshin. You are able to farm echoes as much as you want. However, I still think getting echo EXP takes way too long. Maybe if you're a player since 1.0 you don't have this issue, but as a returning player I have it.

Also, upgrade mats being 60 stamina is just way too much, I think it should be 40. It takes too long to upgrade character levels.

And then you have the talents which are just way too many. Getting the mats for talents is not hard per se, and there's no locked days where you have to wait to farm them(unlike Genshin) however starting at a certain level you basically need the weekly materials for everything, and you're locked to farming those 3 times a week, which makes progression feel incredibly slow.

I feel like I'm always missing materials for everything, whether it is to level up the character, talents, or weapons. Progression feels quite slow, but I love that echo farming is a thing.

The dailies are also very easy to get through.

**Story & Characters 3/10**

Oh boy. I'm gonna include these together because I think a story cannot be good without good characters. I have so much to talk about this. I saw so many people praising 2.0's story as ""peak"", and I'm just confused as to why they would say that.

Let me preface this: I did not read Shorekeeper or Camellya's stories yet(which I saw people saying good things about), nor did I read any main story before 2.0(which I heard mixed things about). I watched a video summary instead. So my rating might've been either higher or lower depending on this.

I think Kuro has cracked the code for gacha. But they did not crack the code for gacha story yet. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe there's a single gacha that can keep up with the story of any real game or any JRPG. I heard good things about Heaven Burns Red and NIKKE, but I haven't read those, maybe they are exceptions.

I don't understand what's up with these gachas that focus so much on NPCs rather than the characters they're trying to sell us on.

As much as I dislike Genshin's story, I think Fontaine was peak gacha story. There was barely any NPC focus, and the NPCs that did have focus(Silver) were good. I even remember Silver's name because he was memorable enough for me to remember him. Why was Fontaine good? Because it had real character arcs throughout the story. I left Fontaine satisfied with the development of most characters: Furina, Lyney, Lynette, Neuvillette and Navia.

Not only that, these characters actually had a personality to them, especially Furina. I thought the whole mystery in Rinascita, the whole mystery plot between the families and all that was so incredibly boring. And it became so convoluted later on that I couldn't keep up with what the characters were saying. Rover was solving the whole mystery while I, the player, didn't even know what was going on after a certain point.

A real good JRPG has proper character arcs, and the main cast actually feels like they're there for a reason. Riddle me this, KURO GAMES: Why does Phoebe even exist? What does she accomplish? It's been 3 acts, and I feel like she could've been changed to a NPC and there would be no difference. I mean, you already used NPCs for so much, so...?

You're trying to sell me these 5 star characters, but all I got from Phoebe is that she has a cute face, and all I got from Zani is that she's overworked and has an italian accent.

Carlotta actually had a proper reason to be in the story because it was mostly focused on the Montelli and the Fisalia family, but that whole plot was so incredibly boring that what I cared most about Carlotta was not her character but actually how attractive she damn is.

Xenoblade Chronicles 2 in a mere 10 chapters develops EVERY SINGLE cast member, as well as the villains. The characters also have distinctive personalities, unlike Roccia for example. Roccia's problem is not only having an unfitting VA, she also has no personality. She is shown as shy, but then next moment she is talking to Rover like they've known each other for so long. She also talks in a boring monotone voice, doesn't stutter at all to show her shyness, and I learned basically nothing about her throughout the three arcs.

I understand it's difficult to develop every character because you're trying to sell them and it would become too convoluted, however I think this problem is easily fixed by having the characters be the focus and not the NPCs. Why do we not have a character on the Fisalia family, for example? It would make the whole plot between the two families more interesting.

As I said before, the characters in the story also had no reason to be there. Once again... just what is Phoebe's actual real purpose? In Xenoblade Chronicles 3(yes I love Xenoblade) it actually makes sense for the characters to stick together. Either because they are childhood friends, or they are in a journey to reach a certain place together. If Shorekeeper was with the Rover throughout the story of Rinascita for example, it would make sense. But instead, they're just focusing on introducing new characters, but not even making them enjoyable enough or have them play an important role in the story.

In all of Rinascita up until this point, I only kind of enjoyed Carlotta and Brant.

The villain was also incredibly boring. Phrolova appears once in Act I or II(I don't exactly recall) to say a single cryptic sentence and then doesn't appear again until Act III. The whole plots of the villains happen off-screen and instead they use and manipulate NPCs behind the scenes, and we never get their POV.

To not use Xenoblade as an example again... Final Fantasy VII Remake(I did not play the original) Sephiroth is an incredible villain. Every time he appears he feels like a real threat. We also get to learn more about his past and reasonings to do what he does, and he's overrall present throughout the whole game, even if for just a short while.

Here, the Fractsidus don't really feel like a real threat, Phrolova just said some cryptic stuff and was talking about a prophecy I didn't care about, and I felt like sleeping.

Kuro Games, you made us type a WHOLE survey that was basically a ""make your waifu/husbando"". I am hoping you can improve both the characters and the story.

The story is already a big improvement from the early chapters, so I have hopes you can crack the code on this as well.

**TL;DR and Overrall Enjoyment Rating 8/10**

I am sticking with Wuthering Waves because I have hope on the devs and I actually am having so much fun. I thought I was done with gacha but Wuthering Waves pulled me back in, not because I'm a gambling addict, but because it's a genuinely good and generous game. If they can improve the story and characters to keep up with real JRPGs/games quality, I am locked in forever.

Other issues like slow progression kind of stop being a real problem once you can clear everything on the game, so I'm fine with it because it still gives me a reason to come back to farm.

Performance needs to be heavily improved on.

Combat is pretty good, although a bit complex. Lack of an elemental system is kinda eh, but it works because everything else makes up for it.

Voice Acting has some weird direction and sometimes the voice doesn't really fit the character, however I like that characters have a distinct accent.

Soundtrack is decent, better than before but can still be better.

reddit_search_1czos7w,Ex-Genshin player's Wuthering Waves Story Review,"I have a lot to say about Wuthering wave's story, which is going to include light spoilers.  Additionally for people like me who are holding out hope for the story to improve I'll add my two cents to that later in a, ""How to Rework Wuthering Wave's story"" post. Obviously any creative types want to pitch solutions, go ahead.

Review:   
A. Characters (4 /10) - Generic as hell.  
You have the amnesiac / chosen one protagonist and his/her harem of Ai generated waifus.  Such as the empathetic one, spunky rookie, serious scientist,  robotic military, isolated monk, the flat chested one, the really thick one, and the cute lolis.  Don't forget Beast Boy, General Chad, and a couple of others I couldn't be bothered to remember.  
The only one that stood as as remotely interesting is Mortefi who's Punk /Diluc aesthetic clashes with his researcher personality.  Unfortunately, it is prophesied in gacha games, the initial roster is the least appealing, destined to be replaced by both stronger / more developed characters in future banners.

B. Pacing (5 /10) - Very slow start.  
Wuthering Waves has two glaring issues, one of them has already been solved by its biggest competitor Genshin Impact.  
The Cataclysm + Unknown Goddess hook was so good people are still speculating about it 4 years later.  But Wuthering Waves decided that it was going to focus on the stranded on a beach + Paimon part instead.  
Secondly, not only does Wuthering Waves not have any hook it literally actively kills any suspense in it's plotline.  They exposition dumped tacit discord right before the giant death angel demon pops out of one, and lore drops the evil Resonator faction right before Scar shows up.  
What saves the pacing from getting a zero is that the pacing does get better later on, and the action does slap hard enough to keep you from checking out of the story completely.

C. Plot (3/10) - Genshin 1.0 but worse?!?  
You have your superpowered gacha good guys called Resonators, you have evil world destroying Abyss monsters called Threnodians, and you have the morally gray Fatui harbingers called Fractsidus.   All of the least interesting aspects of Genshin's plot line served right back at you with a side of science!   
Instead of visions you have radio frequency powers which sound cool until they actually try to explain it, and then you barely live to regret it every time.  
The salt on the wound was that even though Punishing Gray Raven was just another rip off of Nier: Automata.  It at least  stole the good parts.  There were a lot of tragic and interesting moral dilemmas associated with androids fighting a war for a humanity that literally treats them as discardable trash.  
Scar himself saves the plot from being a 0.  When I fought him the first time, I literally obliterated him but the story frustratingly decided that I somehow lost the fight.  From then on Scar was just a charismatic nuisance, and not a credible antagonist that the story keeps trying to claim otherwise.

D. Overall (4/10) - Bad but not unsalvageable.  
The pitch with Wuthering Waves was that it's supposed to be Genshin but more action/ mature.  Which sounds amazing!   
However, in practice what you have  are a  bunch of boring working class super humans whose social lives are completely ruined by an undead army that's only going to get stronger with every patch.  So most conversations are going to revolve around their jobs, history of resonance waves, killing Threnodians, helping victims,  or getting something to eat.  
This is why the main story of Wuthering Waves is actually insanely short, because they have to supplement boring adult small talk with more action, and it turns out action scenes are pretty expensive.

reddit_search_1d00dzq,Final Thoughts on Wuthering Wave's Chapter 1 [Spoiler: THE ENTIRE CHAPTER 1],"(tl;dr at the bottom because i have chronic yapper syndrome)

Having finished Wuthering Wave's Chapter 1 and gone through the finale of it, I feel inclined to share my thoughts and my opinion though this is partially to also have an easier place to share my opinion to my friends. Take note that there'll be plenty of spoilers throughout this review. I'll be trying not to compare the plot to other gacha games to avoid biases.

Additionally, I will not be weighing in the core gameplay and the, uh, voice acting towards it at all. But there will be certain gameplay elements that add to the atmosphere of the plot and the overall theme of it, which will be factored into these thoughts. Also, this'll mainly be discussing the main plotline without looking into the companion stories / side quests.

With that in mind,

I'll be separating these thoughts into three sections:  
Intro, Midpoint and then lastly the Finale.

The intro will mostly cover the section pre-Scar, where they introduce the world as a whole and the cast (including Rover). From the get-go, Wuthering Waves drops a lot of exposition and loredump with zero context at the start. Jargon that would have been better introduced during the player's first exposure into them are instead loredumped from the beginning,

In essence, they drop exposition after exposition to the point that it seems like the intention is to fluff up and add substance (shallow or otherwise) into the plot points. While some of these plot points do seem interesting, they'd definitely have a lot more impact had they been introduced in a more cinematic way.

The fact that the supporting cast shows up as a duo that heaps information after information does not contribute positively to this, as they are then essentially required by their lore and core characteristics to explain what is already common logic and knowledge to the characters in question. (For instance, there is no reason for Yangyang to not explain what the core antagonistic elements are to Rover upon realizing that the latter has zero information / memories about the threats of the world.)

This could have been better handled by, instead, gradually introducing the cast to Rover and with it the corresponding information. You encounter enemies and end up fending them off, encounter Yangyang, Yangyang explains the threats you fought after introductions. You encounter another group of enemies, harvest an Echo, the Terminal and the Echoes are explained. So on and so forth.

Instead, they are heaped onto the player back to back with zero recourse which can cause people to lose track of what's being introduced fast.

Worse, the rapid slew of character introductions leave them with shallow/surface-level characterization at best as they're left with smaller windows to be part of the main plot. Though this /might/ be rectified by future character/companion quests, the sequences that they are currently apart of leave it hard to care or notice their presence and unique characterizations.

The Crownless sequence in the intro, while cinematic and introduces finisher sequences (which do look cool), ends up feeling shallow in the long run as the plot points foreshadowed during the sequence loses impact due to the character reactions and the abrupt exposition on the Terminal before Rover absorbs it into his body. It doesn't help that the cast's reaction almost forces down another foreshadowing down your throat (hint hint, Rover might be that special legend spoken of in history books).

It could have been better composed if, say, The immediate supporting cast eased the player into this knowledge or even outright just treated it with suspicion / uncertainty rather than just outright going: 'you're special! you're amazing!'. It cheapens the truth behind Rover by instead making them the central figure almost by force, and making it obvious to the player from the get-go. Which, in turn, heavily affects any possible surprises about Rover and their past down the road. Not to say that it cannot be done right, of course, as there are some plots that have done this right but...

Then we get to the puzzle hunt, which starts off with the cast venerating Rover with zero real weight or reason behind it. Already, the truth behind Rover becomes really obvious due to the lack of proper veiling behind it. At first, I thought it was going to be a red herring that then turns out to be that Rover wasn't the chosen one but...

It, again, ends up as a shallow method of forcing more lore expositions that adds weight to the backstory. But these are expositions that do not do more than just build the history and the story of the past. Which, while effective, only does so when there is something that links the past events to the current events, something that showcases it and its importance to the player.

Which does not exist in this case, outside of highlighting what is obvious: Rover is the legendary figure that the supporting cast already spoke about again and again.

Moving on from the intro and onto the midpoint,

Scar.

Scar's introduction is amazing, that much I will concede. Hats off to his English VA as he nailed the performance pretty well. That being said, the exposition with Scar does add that cinematic feel to it, that looming flair of a darker element. But,

It is surface-level at best. A lot of people have praised this sequence to me, and some have said that this is when the plotline gets better but as the story progresses, this very encounter with Scar adds zero weight/gravitas to it in the long run. It is entirely forgotten in the story, the anecdote he gives and the truth behind the village that he speaks of do not add weight to the story. It is, at best, atmospheric. And while atmospheric approaches are GREAT for building the tension and the plot leading up to it...

The plot does... nothing with it. It introduces Scar, showcases his talents only for another one of his allies to show up which, while it introduces the group, kind of cheapens Scar's moment. At first, I thought that the lamb in Scar's story had survived, and that it was either Jinhsi or the girl with him but... yeah, I was proven wrong fast.

Then I thought that maybe it wasn't black-and-white, that what happened to the town was in fact orchestrated by the forces we thought were good. But then I was proven wrong. Again. And it turned out that all these possible plot hooks to make the plotline deeper are just, instead, left abandoned after that cinematic moment.

We are, instead, treated to sequences where Rover is praised by ally and enemy alike, removing much of the aggressive tension and instead leaving that concept that: 'wow, Rover is loved by their allies and their enemies. Rover is wanted by all. Rover is important to everyone.' which ends up becoming shallow and tiring fast.

The plot progresses, and more groups are introduced. They introduce a group that is, apparently, impossible to pin down but somehow the protagonistic faction knows about them already and knows how to contact them. Even knows that peculiar flower they keep on them to announce to one another their affiliation. And again, said group fellates Rover and praises them, wants them and outright worships them.

Rover is treated like a god, worshipped and praised for virtually zero build up and zero reason. There is a complete lack of tension or impact behind it which, at this point, starts to negatively affect the story.

Then we get to the finale.

The finale, at a surface level, is amazing. It is very cinematic. The characters converge and unite, a looming threat finally descends and a calamity falls over the city. Through unity, they form a front that works to push back the calamity. A division of labor, some stay behind to fight, some stay to lead, some push forward and lead themselves in an increasingly smaller squad. I'll stay behind, you go. I believe in you.

- circa 2000+, all blockbuster films

The finale, as soon as you realize it and look deeper than what is being presented, becomes increasingly shallow. Characters are introduced. Again. And you don't know any of these characters but they know you and trust you. They believe in you that you are their hope, so they do anything and everything to accommodate you. They fight against this threat that doesn't feel like a threat at all at this point, they unite because the rain makes it so that the enemy can and will show up everywhere.

But they don't, they only show up when it's convenient to the plot. A barrier apparently protects the city, but the time is running out. The soldiers, through a vaccine, are immune to something that could have been very interesting to tackle (the phantoms from the rain) and they are instead beset by Tacet Discords in direct combat.

Though only sparingly, you don't necessarily see the tension even though they speak of it and illustrate it.

They showcase Jiyan's story and his backstory through silhouettes, regaling the already narrated sequence again for dramatic effect. Which could have been done better to showcase more of Jiyan's characteristics, but instead he speaks of his resolve and walks past the clearly crazed phantom of his former general. They reveal the fact that Jiyan was the doctor that walked into the frontlines which, if you've been paying attention to the lore, have been dropped several times by now. He musters up his resolve and stonewalls the trauma, pops a pill and goes forward.

Then, the same stoic general, meets Rover and trusts Rover with everything including the strategy for pushing forward in the decisive conflict.

You divide the labor, and you and Yangyang rush to protect the cannon that'll help win the fight. But lo! The forces guarding it have been whittled down, so you run in to save the day. Then they showcase a dying soldier who leaves it entirely to your hands, adding a sequence where Yangyang looks on sadly... for an attempt at an emotional impact.

They showcase a cutscene where the army runs forward then cuts into a fun interactive sequence of rushing past. But the tension and the gravitas of the scene are heavily impacted (negatively) by the brevity of it. You run forward, fighting enemies. The surrounding soldiers aren't shown struggling whatsoever, there are no direct casualties or trouble. Not even a brief moment to showcase that the soldiers are being pushed back and that the time is against you, that you have to your best and not let their sacrifices in vain.

But wait, there's zero real tension or impact. The battles could have, instead of cutting down obstacles in your path, been helping out the part of your forces being whittled down as you move forward. At times even showcasing that you cannot turn back, so even if some of the forces are dying behind you, you have to push forward.

Then we get to the point where you now climb the giant golem after the cannon broke the field.

They... waste a second shot with said cannon just to break some buildings and open a hole in the buildings. Hmm... by now, people are staying behind to hold off the enemy forces. You progress through an admittedly fun level, pulling boulders, jumping up and so on. Yangyang stays behind, going into a long exposition that it's your time to shine with Jiyan.

Then the finale.

That final sequence...

Jiyan + Rover vs Crownless (then ???).

What happens? A very cinematic fight, that much I will concede. It was beautifully choreographed and the QTE sequences where you have to do x and y, swapping between Rover and Jiyan to hit the enemy. Rover's awakening to Havoc, they are all very interesting and cinematic. But that's it.

It's cinematic, with zero real character impact. The only impact that happens is the impact of Jiyan's spears deflecting the projectiles, of Rover's wing + sword combo beating up the enemy as Rover finally taps into the Crownless Echo they absorbed into their body. But then what? The enemy is defeated, and they save the day. Everyone is shown to be alright, tired but beaten.

But that's it.

And that's exactly what I said after I finished that sequence: ""that's it?""

The story showcases amazing cinematics, a lot of lore exposition and a lot of characters with great character designs. There is vast potential, but each and every time I think that, I end up getting disappointed. They could do so much with what they have on hand, but instead it feels like I'm playing an action blockbuster produced by so and so director. There is a lot of action and cinematic tropes, but zero real substance. An attempt at having depth in the lore through countless of exposition, but not really digestible at all.

tl;dr:

Wuthering Waves' plot and story play out like an action blockbuster film with all of its tropes and predictability, and none of its brevity. You are treated to an overly drawn-out shocking plot twists that are not only very obvious and apparent even to the characters in question but also the player, only for said plot twists to not really deliver.

The plotline is very cheap and shallow, instead gong for the easy way-out of a tried-and-tested formula. Rover's backstory could have been interesting, the character could have been interesting, but they instead go for the: 'wow, amazing legendary figure beloved by all' which cheapens not only Rover themselves but the characters and factions in question.

In short: the game plays out like a power fantasy of an action blockbuster director. Zero impact, zero weight, a lot of explosions and action sequences. Good moments here and there, but those moments are cheapened by the empty plot. It's meant to be post-apocalyptic or somewhat hopeless but none of that is present.

  
Finally, if you've read through that long ass post. Thank you. I could probably shorten it but I wanted to make sure that I addressed every plot point in my mind. Even if not and you just scrolled down for the tl;dr: if there's a point you want to ask / contest, feel free and I'll give my thoughts even if it ends up a reiteration.

reddit_search_1k1b76v,"My Wuthering Week with WuWa: A ""newbie's"" amateur review of the story and the game","I tried Wuthering Waves a few weeks on launch but never really gave it a fair shot and dropped it for other reasons. I heard that the new Rinascita story was amazing, and that the story was getting better and better since the launch, but it feels... off... to just skip entire acts just to get to the latest story. I also remember there was discussion about how BAD the story of Wuthering Waves was at launch. So after finally setting aside some time, I decided to find out for myself the answer to the question **""Is the beginning of Wuthering Wave's story bad?""** and **""When does the story of Wuthering Waves get good?""**

Well to keep it short after 1 week of finishing 1 act per day, I reached Act 7 of the game, and  here are my takeaways of the story: 

* Is the story bad? No. Act 1's intro is the worst, but it builds lore. just lacks some kind of ""wow"" factor.
* When does it get good? To me it raises interest at Act 3, starts getting eye catching at Act 6, raises the bar at Act 7. 

Overall from the story, I felt like the Prologue and Acts 1-5 were... alright. It sets up the overall plot of the game, builds the world you'll be exploring, but the presentation seemed... lacking, as if the concept was fine, but the execution lacked a sense of grandness or epicness. Character building is also lacking in these Acts as we mostly hang out with Yangyang and Chixia.  They were characterized fine, but we meet at least 4 other characters who barely get characterized, which is made apparent when for a short time Alto and Encore show up and were instantly memorable to be around. The fight for your partnership between Jinzhou and >!the Fractsidus!< (the bad guys) is interesting because you're an important amnesiac, are you sure you're trusting the people you first meet? 

Act 6 and 7 is the payoff for all that lore setup. Jiyan, Changli and Jinshi were all tied into the story beautifully and as the plot progressed, so did their characterization. >!Jiyan is a serious general with alot of responsibility and expectations to carry, Changli is a caring mentor to Jinshi willing to shave off her life to help her, and Jinshi is a noble and benevolent leader who's responsible and cares for her mother figure. There's even a funny moment I noticed where Jue the Sentinel kept saying ""one"" to refer to themselves at the beginning of her introduction, but as soon as she argued with Jinshi about her safety, she started using ""I"" instead, like the whole ""one"" reference is for business. !<

**The Pros:** 

* The game is action combat. Most of your abilities are responsive, like dodging and casting skills.
* Game also has good exploration. The 3D environment is climbable, you can run with little to no limit, and you can glide down. There's fall damage, can be easily mitigated/cancelled
* The echo system is a great ""catch 'em all"" mechanic where you collect your gear, and it's interesting to see most of it not tied to the stamina system like usual gacha gear progression
* All quests you can do can be done in any order, so you're free to do any of them in the order you like
* The game has an amazing engine that can animate action scenes in the middle of its dialogue. Most fluid action scenes would have the animators make a prerendered cutscene, but instead we get such dynamic, in game, displays instead.
   * The game's engine is ALSO capable of rendering NPCs and mobs attacking in the open world and instances, which I think is also a great indication that they can show alot of creative action scenes with just the engine alone. 
* The gadget system is great, grappler for mobility, a sensor for treasure, and my favorite concept, a personal shooter for shooting mechanics. Saves having to change to a party member who might be underleveled to be used as a shooting bot. 

**The Cons:** 

* The English voice acting is still terrible. Yangyang's is the worst of all, dull and out of context, which is a stark contrast to SOME of her attack voices. ""Let me be your blade..."" How about NO! Take the fan's money, and go back to the studio and FIX THIS! (Or don', it’s just almost every time something emotional happens, Yangyang opens her mouth with the most lifeless dialogue I've ever heard and it breaks my heart...)
* The story had a habit of telling us about jargon, but not showing it, and then repeating the jargon again when there is something to show. An example is at the beginning of the game, Yangyang tells us about an ""Etheric Sea"" and a ""Tacet Field"", but then repeats these jargons again, but this time shows what said ""Tacet Field"" is. Might need to stop doing the former, and keep the latter instead. This peeve is small though.
* The quest indicator doesn't seem to prioritize whatever quest chain you're on, because I kept getting reset to do the top quest on the main quest tab which is NOT the Act 7 Main quest and instead is ""Wish Upon the Moon"" questline, or something. I wish they'd put a lock to remember and go to the next story chain you chose, instead of resetting while doing said quest chains. 
* It feels like the element system serves little purpose. A minor damage boost/reduction, but nothing that interesting.
* Sometimes movement can get wonky while fighting on uneven terrain. You or the enemy end up falling into a small ledge and now you gotta climb up or chase down.

**The Interesting:** 

* Wuthering Waves feels like a “main” game. The type of game that you would lose hours to complete, not the type that you play for 30 mins and then log out to do something else, not at first at least. I can see it becoming like that when you reach the max Union level and have all the echoes. You can argue by that point you’ve completed the main game’s content, but for a new player there’s so much to do you, you’ll lose hours if you like the game
* As free flowing as combat is, it's also demanding of attention, especially with bosses. You can choose to spam your attacks all you like, but those parry windows demand your basic attack to hit on time, or else you eat that damage or prepare to dodge. I like that you have the option to either go brainless and keep attacking and just dodge out of these parry windows, or be methodical and time their attacks with the parries
* The world is dark from Prologue to Act 6, and that reflects on the active Tacet Discord Threat. It feels like the original direction was that this is an apocalyptic world, or at least on the brink of it. It changes a bit when reaching Mt. Firmament, that has a snowy, brighter landscape, which in itself has a beautiful contrast to Jinzhou
* There's special enemies that hit INCREDIBLY hard, but when dodged, you get a special buff to do percentage damage on the enemy. It's perfect for practicing the stronger mobs around, and also rewarding to memorize their attack pattern and get higher tier echoes. 
* I found an interesting challenge mode that seems to have a challenge level setting, but it's restricted to higher level players. Not something a new player should worry about, but something to look forward to for people staying
* It's an open world game. For explorers, this means you have alot of reason to go around the map and find every little secret the devs intended to hide from your grubby little mitts. Unfortunately, I finally realized I'm not an explorer, I'm an expeditioner. I like small little dungeons with a number of the secrets hidden, so open worlds can keep their secrets for me, I just want to get to the thing that isn't lit up yet.
* Bosses can grab you. You may be on the receiving end of an asswhooping, but you're gonna love hating how much you got dunked on. 
* Sometimes the story provides trial characters during crucial story points. I like that because I just wanted to do all the main story acts within a week, which leads to;
* You may not know Baizhi, but you're gonna love her and any other healer resonators, cause even with the sub-optimal gear I had during my whole expedition, I can brute force the story as long as I dodged and healed back to half health.

I hope this post was good, informative, or at least not offensive. Lemme know where I can improve in this kind of review case I get possessed into doing one of these again. 

The rest of this post is just my recollection of the story. I have nowhere else to put it, so here you go. Spoilers added in case you wanted to experience it for yourself.

**Prologue:** 

The intro was alright and the tutorial was straight and to the point. We're made by a goddess, you wake up as an amnesiac Rover, Yangyang and Chixia were nice, who I will now refer to as the Yanggang, they teach you movement, climbing, fighting, then you fight your first Tacet Discords. You learn about the Sentinel of their town, Jue the Loong (an eastern dragon). Eventually you meet Baizhi, fight your first boss, the Crownless, and win. Simple stuff. The invitation Jingshi the Magistrate sent out to come to town confused me, cause I know they said that the message was random and encoded for the Rover, but the way that City Hall's entrance was empty, and how the Yanggang told me that there were people there earlier that Sanhua shooed made me NOT connect the dots that there was supposed to be a crowd there, felt like a crowd should have been added there to emphasize the range of people who got the message. We meet Sanhua ourselves, pass her vibe check and gives us Tokens and tells us our Magistrate is in another castle. The tokens felt kinda abrupt, like suddenly we're off to find a Mcguffin, but looking back now I know it was still part of the test. 

**Act 1:** 

I hated this act’s intro the most because we go in a lab and it was mostly fetch quests, so much exposition dumping just around the terms with little to no illustration to explain the tokens, and only stopped hating it after getting into the Simulation Training room and it showed the big bad of the future act. Story wise, I think this was where we find out what token number 1 was about? >!A candy that's supposed to be medicine for children years ago.!< Overall I think this is where the story is at its worst, but at least it's over

**Act 2**: 

This was a simple but satisfying act. Jianxin was introduced and pretty well characterized as a kind person who goes above and beyond, as well as a disciplined and pragmatic person. Decent introduction to the Midnight Rangers as well, how much they're working hard and how invested they are with the Northen Barens war. We get some directions from Yangyang about where to go next and we're off to meet my favorite guy. Side note, we find out what token number 2 and 3 is, >!a \~\~grenade\~\~ mangosteen that gets imported from that south, where the leaf with TD energy points us to Qingchi village. !<

**Act 3:** 

This act was interesting. We go to the village, and we explore the place. Find out that the people there used to do ritualistic sacrifices and we learn about our favorite boy band >!the Fractsidus!<, the bad boys of Wuthering Waves. AND THEN WE MEET >!SCAR!<! My favorite guy in the whole chapter. He meets us alone and tells us to look again and we get to see pretty picture books of how human sacrifices were made, how considerate, cause I thought that was a good change of pace from all the dialogue I read since I started playing the game. He gives a great twist to the friendly characters you meet as an amnesiac trope by suggesting that maybe they're putting on an act as you ARE an important character, and there are groups that want you as an ally for your specialness. And not only that, he treats me to a decent fight to cap off the act. What a considerate guy. Oh yeah and then we reunite with Yangyang and solve the ritual sacrifice that happened on the village. I feel like something's missing though... >!I can feel it in my onigiri...!<

**Act 4:** 

We go back to Jinzhou and figure out where to go via token number 4. >!We solve the puzzle!<, and it leads us to the Grand Library where we try to can probably find out about our past. We do a decent puzzle, not much lore on this part, and then we meet >!Scar !<again. This time we take him on seriously and get treated to a 2nd phase. After getting our asses kicked by defeating >!Scar the Fell Omen!<, we capture him with the help of Jinshi and Sanhua. >!Turns out we met them the night before we went into the Grand Library and she explains a major problem for the city. She lost her pet gecko Jue, the Sentinel and has been looking for it after she sent out the message. So after explaining how much she needs our help, and giving us the puppy dog eye treatment  we're totally on board with Team Jinzhou and have Scar carted off to jail, but not before he revealed a secret to the Magistrate that we'll have to discover later. Here we're also told about another secret boy band called the Black Shores where they're apparently good guys, but we don't know enough about them.!<

**Act 5:** 

This entire chapter is more world building, and we kind of take a detour from the Jinzhou chapter. >!So we meet up with the Yanggang and start looking for a Shore that's Black, our only clue being a black flower that we seem to have worn in our past. We go find someone who knows about flowers and end up finding Verina, who makes us counterfeits to lure out Black Shore members. We split up for a bit from the Yanggang to find some Black Shores and we actually find one. Camellya, and we have an... exciting conversation with her about Black Shores and seeds. Anyway, we go nowhere with that lore expansion yet, so we meet up with the Yanggang to find a better couple of characters, Alto and Encore. Alto being a sleezy info broker and Encore being a child with scary teddy bears. They run and hide from us, but in reality lured you away from the Yanggang to reveal they're from the Black Shores frfr and they're here for BS stuff. They share that they were gonna fix a Resonance Beacon they monitor, and Alto has a side project to look for some researchers and their research stuff. You find their lab first, which was experimenting on something called the Retroact Rain, which replays events that happened in an area and spawn Phantoms, ghosts of the past that you can watch and hear. We find out they weren't just studying the Retroact Rain, but were also recreating Freddy Fasbear's reject cousin, and we end up fighting it. After decommissioning that art, Alto finds the Resonance Beacon they were looking for, and it gives off a worrying discovery...!<

**Act 6:** 

Back to the Jinzhou arc, this chapter alone is twice or even 3 times as large as the other chapters, but I think this chapter pays off half of the setup made by the previous chapters. >!Apparently, a Retroact Rain is happening on the Jinzhou, which only happens... when the Threnodian is waking up, the big bad of the region everyone's been preparing to go to war over. We meet up with all the Jinzhou NPCs, including NPCs we've never met on the main story. Taoqi explains the Retroact Rain will spawn Phantoms that are realistic and dangerous, they have defenses ready, but a TD outbreak is going to happen. Meanwhile, this chapter also expands on Jiyan's character and past, who participated in the old war, and the old General's Phantom appears, corrects me by calling him John, and tests him with a small TD wave fight. We play John and fight the Phantoms and TDs, and we pass the old General's vibe check.  After all of that downtime and preparation, the combat starts on both the Jinzhou defense and the Midnight Ranger's base. It really feels like a war because of all the action. On the Jinzhou defense it's a small skirmish of fighting mobs and at the end even has a save the NPCs mission, while on the General's side, it's defend the North and South positions. !<

>!After all the defenses are finished, Rover and Yangyang decide to go to the general to help, and Jiyan meets up with the Rover to escort them to the camp, seeing the rock formation form the body of the Threnodian and Jiyan reveals that the Rover was prophesized to take some sort of power back from the Threnodian, so they all conclude that they need to kill the Threnodian to stop the rain and get back Rover's power. At base we meet Jianxin again, the cast has to help the army prepare their cannon to hit a barrier the Threnodian placed on itself for protection, and have the idiotic decision to let the amnesiac decide what the battle formation will be. The next section tho, I LOVE this entire section. The objective is to get to the Threnodian, so you fire the laser cannon, break through the barrier, and run through the warzone to kill the Threnodian. So much to appreciate while you're getting through the area, NPCs fighting mobs while you run, the sliding mechanic, a new way to use the Grapple which include: Pulling apart weak rock formations, pulling platforms towards you or pulling yourself on a platform to a target, and my favorite, pulling rock formations apart to instakill trash mobs. It reminds me so much of the old God of War games. Across the war, you get to fight some random TDs as you go, including some elite bosses you may or may not have fought in the fields before, and I like it cause it keeps you on your toes and shows how chaotic a war can get. !<

>!You eventually reach your destination, near the chest of the sleeping Threnodian, and you call out the signal to fire at the chest. Jianxin leaves the party early through the run to hold off TDs, Yangyang stays behind by the end to do the same thing, so it's a date between me and Jiyan vs the boss. We go into the opening the laser provides and we enter a pocket dimension to fight the boss. It starts with the Crownless, who dies pretty easily, but when he loses he gets eaten by the floating orb at the background to make Dreamless, Blade of Michellin. The boss fight was good, skill issues aside, there was alot of quick-time events and an interesting homage to Kingdom Hearts where Jiyan has to spam attack to block out projectiles. Mid fight, a cutscene plays and we manage to get back the ""power"" that we lost, and Rover now unlocks his Havoc mode. With our new power, we kill the Dreamless but it prepares an explosion in an attempt to kill us with it, but we're saved by a mysterious talking plushy that comes out of our Tacet Mark that eats the explosion. With the Dreamless dead, the Retroact Rain stops, we escape the pocket dimension, and we get to see a cutscene of everyone we fight with enjoy the sunrise of a tomorrow they won in this war. !<

**Act 7:** 

This act is a long one, about the same length as Act 6, maybe a bit longer, but I personally think this is where players who were on edge about the story will start to love it, and also pays of the half of the story arc opening up more about the world's lore. >!The act opens with the WuWa devs realizing that Scar was right, and that picture books for dummies like me is the perfect way to illustrate backstory. They talk about how the marketable plush is a sentient Echo unique in that he lives inside Rover's hollow skull where his memories are supposed to be, also it is a very hungry thing. The plush being peeved about getting called a little one, it demanded a name, and everyone decides to call the plush Abby. Abby is satisfied with the name, everyone's still curious what it does, and at best, we get a shiny glow from it after Abby tries to show off its power, but that's about it. For now, everyone's still figuring out what to do next and gets a suggestion to go find the Magistrate. We go to City Hall, find Sanhua, and find out the Magistrate might be in trouble, cause last time she talked to Jinshi, she was becoming scaly, and looked weakened. From interrogating Scar they find out that they attacked the Sentinel and it's now in hiding to rest. She tells us we're gonna need to go to a dock to meet a Wayfinder to get your to Mt. Firmament, which is a perfect coincidence because before you went to Sanhua, you were talking with Abby about a dream you had that you were there with the Sentinel to save a village from a TD outbreak.!<

>!With your destination set, you got to the docks and meet with the Wayfinder, Changli the Jinzhou Councilor. She gives you some backstory that Mt Firmament is a place with an altered time effect where getting in will alter your time and getting out of the place will take years off your life, and only one guy was never affected: you, the Rover. So after that explanation, you set sail and reach the island. The island is full of machines called Chronosorters used to solve puzzles and manipulate landscape, and you use these later as you explore. On the island you notice that there's animals frozen in time. Changli explains that something must have happened to the Sentinel to cause that effect, and they need to help the Sentinel to rescue the life that's suffering in frozen time. We go to Hongzhen Village to look for clues where we find the Fractsidus, some moving, some frozen in time, and villagers victim to the time freeze. We fight and go look for more clues and find survivors in a hidden chamber made by Jinshi when she was rescuing villagers. Xinyi, the leader of the village pointed the Magistrate to a Cipher key that she needs to find to meet the Sentinel, as it can unlock the defenses they setup to help it in its resting place. Xinyi relays this information to us so we can help the Magistrate, and we set off to go look for her.  !<

>!As you explore the place where the Cipher key is hidden, you find research notes from the Court of Savantis. in order, you find out: The Sentinel has been injured and lost the ability to fix the time it rewinds or freezes; The Chronosorters were made to fix it, but don't really work in huge ranges or fix the time altered; They attempted something called a ""Second Resonance Awakening"" to power up a bunch of Chronosorters and fix the timeline but they all turned to dust and failed; You were involved with the Sentinel. After finding the notes, you find Jinshi as well, who we talk to about what she's doing all of this for. Apparently, Jinshi was told a prophecy that she'd have to fight the Sentinel for some reason, and was always afraid of that day, but after finding out that the Sentinel was injured and can't fix the timestream, she's felt like she needs to help it. While exploring with Jinshi we find a note saying that she was a baby resurrected by the Sentinel, and her resurrection maybe why the timeline can't be fixed. With that and additional info of the Second Resonance Awakening, Jinshi realizes this might be why she has to ""fight"" the Sentinel and then get its powers to fix everything in Mt. Firmament. With her resolve set and a reminder she has friends, we decide to help her find the Sentinel and help it however we can. After a big brain puzzle with the Chronosorters and a new puzzle called a Flare Chrest, we get the Cipher key and head back to the Villager's Secret Chamber to talk to Xinyi and to find Mianloong Chamber. !<

>!Going to Mianloong Chamber we realize that the Fractsidus had trapped the Sentinel with the Chronosorters and Flare Crests, so it's up to us to solve another big brain Chronosorter and Flare Crest puzzle and free it. After said puzzle and Changli leaving behind to get rid of the Fractsidus following us, we free and finally meet Jue, the Jinzhou Sentinel in the flesh. She greets us as a ""Lord Arbiter"" and thanks Jinshi for freeing her. However she presents to us a moral dilemma: Her injury is why she returns to Mt. Firmament to rest, but it's not going to last forever and she's dying. Since she can't fix the timeline for everything frozen and suffering, she can at least freeze everything in Jinzhou painlessly, so that eventually someone can figure out how to solve the mess before she dies and everything freezes and suffers forever. Jinshi refuses this, and suggests that she achieve a Second Awakening instead by fighting Jue. It's an emotional and touching moment where mother and daughter argue over the potential risk. If Jinshi fails she suffers an eternity in frozen time and pain, but the Magistrate is firm in her resolve, and with that convinces the Sentinel to prepare to fight. With us spectating and given a... strange task to click ""yes"" when copy pasting the Sentinel's time manipulation ability to Jinshi, and the permission to fight with her, we all set off to a pocket dimension to fight the Sentinel. !<

>!The fight is epic and the music is amazing, you get to use the Grappler to catch up to Jue as she moves far, really far when she moves. The background is just a pond with stone arches around it and it's on a sunset view, perfect for a duel. When Jue's HP is down, a minigame happens where you outshoot the Dragon's orb barrage, and eventually our Magistrate wins the fight. With the win secured, we the Rover give the permission to transfer the time powers to Jinshi, she grows horns to symbolize her newfound strength, and after grabbing the Time power orb, she struggles for a bit and achieves a Second Awakening, successfully inheriting all of Jue's time powers, and restores the flow of time to Mt. Firmament, unfreezing everyone and everything. It tires Jinshi out, but Jue cradles her in a time bubble and speaks to us privately about our past. We find out that: We made Jue, we are her master and we made Jinzhou, but she doesn't know anything more apart from that; Only we have the power to open that Pocket Dimension and transfer her powers; Jinshi has all her time powers now; and Mt Firmament is back to normal, except for the part where if you leave you lose your life, so not a perfect solution but at least no one's frozen. Jue meets Abby, who was asleep through the whole thing, she remarks that Abby feels familiar, but doesn't know anything about Abby. Jue then points us to the Black Shores again, the place where the BS members are, and drops a god damn title drop as she leaves to get Jinshi back to Jinzhou. We get to enjoy a sliding down the mountain minigame, a cutscene of our happy ending with the villagers unfrozen in time, and a teaser of the Fractsidus members getting ready to prison break Scar and start new trouble elsewhere. !<",19,5,1744891806.0,WutheringWaves,Aegister2,0.89,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1k1b76v/my_wuthering_week_with_wuwa_a_newbies_amateur/

reddit_search_1d704qm,Wuthering Waves Engine.ini Tweaks to Improve VRAM and RAM usage to Reduce Stuttering with Image Comparisons!,"**CHECK** **UPD. 02.07.2024**.**CHECK UPD. 05.07.2024.**

Want to remind that modifying game files can easily result in a ban. However, if they do so, it would be hilariously absurd and overall make them look worse. Consider all warnings about bans due to modifying Engine.ini as merely a legal maneuver for them to ban someone without stating a reason.If you're still worried, I've been using tweaks since the game's release, and nothing has happened. 😎 But if you get banned, it's not my fault - it's all on your responsibility. 😋

**If some tweaks are missing, or some tweaks do nothing or make things worse - I apologize**.

**Please don't blindly copy and paste them into Engine.ini! It's better to read the entire post, and even better to check out the recommended posts. Additionally, before writing a review, please play around with these tweaks for 1-2 days. Upon the first launch, there might be either a long loading time or lag for the first five minutes. Don't jump to conclusions based on first impressions!** 🤗

These tweaks should **reduce stutters, freezes**, the game should start to **memorize shaders**, **compile them faster** and **use multi-threaded CPU better**, most likely you will see a little increase in GPU load, bc **my goal was to shift the load from CPU to GPU**, + there will be **a greater increase in VRAM and maybe RAM usage**. Graphics should get even better + **you can find useful tips here**, about sharpening, GPU usage and so on. ✨

**If you have less than 5 gigabytes of VRAM (GPU RAM), please remove:**

    r.Streaming.LimitPoolSizeToVRAM=1

In addition to this tweak - there are other tweaks like ""r.Streaming"" that affect VRAM usage, but I have forgotten which ones... 😶, but in general these are the most influential.

Here you can find each tweak responsibility: [UE4 Console Variables and Commands](https://framedsc.com/GeneralGuides/ue4_commands.htm).

I also want to express a **HUGE** thanks to three posts that helped a lot of people, including me, so a **HUGE** thank you to the authors of these posts:

Please review them too! There's more description on what each tweak does, with great feedback!

How to install these tweaks and where to write them - all you can learn from the posts above, because my English is not as good as I would like, I am afraid that I can not explain everything so easily and simply, as it is already done in the posts linked above. ⭐

I'm not very experienced in this, but after three+- days of learning, + with the help of ChatGPT and friends who know a little bit about this topic, managed to create this collection of tweaks for Engine.ini:

Regarding ""\[/Script/Engine.InputSettings\]"" - I don't really know if it affects if you write it directly here, not in Input.ini. 😔

Regarding others, like:

    [/Script/Engine.GarbageCollectionSettings]
    gc.CreateGCClusters=1
    
    [/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]
    r.CreateShadersOnLoad=1 
    niagara.CreateShadersOnLoad=1

They're embedded in ""\[SystemSettings\]"". (you can put tweaks under \[SystemSettings\] and they'll work)

All tweaks at the bottom are already included at the top, you don't need to add them, only remove them, if you don't like them. 🤔

I didn't find out much information about ""r.Streaming"" tweaks, so they're totally questionable, maybe it's even better without them.

    r.Streaming.FullyLoadUsedTextures=1
    r.Streaming.HLODStrategy=2
    r.Streaming.DropMips=0
    r.Streaming.UseAllMips=0
    r.Streaming.MipBias=0

This tweak may be dead in general, so it may do neither worse nor better, but I still decided to use it just in case:

    s.AsyncLoadingThreadEnabled=1

Turns off cringe [CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration) filter:

    r.SceneColorFringeQuality=0

Disabling HDR, it's better not to try to turn it on (as of today), because you can easily get your monitor burned out or get the blue screen of death, you can start with HDR, but it's better not to do it.If you decided to play with HDR, don't use these tweaks:

    r.HDR.EnableHDROutput=0
    r.HDR.UI.CompositeMode=0
    r.HDR.Display.OutputDevice=0
    r.HDR.Display.ColorGamut=0

I decided to turn off Screen Space Reflections (SSR), because their implementation is very strange, water with lots of artifacts if you stand near it.If you want to keep SSR, remove these lines:

    r.SSR.Quality=0
    r.SSR.Temporal=0
    r.SSR.MaxRoughness=0

**Useless with DLSS**.TAA tweaks:

    r.DefaultFeature.AntiAliasing=2
    r.PostProcessAAQuality=6
    r.TemporalAA.Algorithm=0
    r.TemporalAA.Upsampling=0
    r.TemporalAACurrentFrameWeight=0.35
    r.TemporalAAFilterSize=0.1

Tweaks that you can look into, but I decided not to use them due to the need of extensive testing. It's also unclear what values to assign to them and which ones would be better: 10 / 30 / 1 / 0. 🥶

    s.LevelStreamingComponentsUnregistrationGranularity=?
    s.LevelStreamingComponentsRegistrationGranularity=?

Also do not forget that the game looks better if you turn the brightness to minimum, as well as you can replace the DLSS built into the game 3.5, to a newer 3.7.10+.

All of these were tested for three days, there should be no problems in general, but Wuthering Waves also had 3+- betas 🥴, so, if you find any problem - write feedback immediately! 😈

Have a good game! 🎮

\*also ty **shimuto** and **r1ddick**.

**UPD. 02.07.2024. ---**

While collecting and testing new tweaks, came across something that in general I could have noticed before, but came across only now, **Wuwa does not utilize GPU's C or P-states properly**.

(Power-saving states designed to reduce the power consumption of the GPU when it is idle or under low load. Allow the GPU to enter different levels of reduced power consumption based on its activity)

You can see this even on my screenshots - there is 1200 MHz, but I have GPU that can take all 2000+, **this applies only to those, who do not have the maximum performance setting in Power management mode by default in NVIDIA Control Panel!** If your GPU is at 70% usage, you can leave ""energy efficiency"" features, it consumes less voltage, so less temperature, and fps will be about the same, but if you need a reserve, or Wuwa using 100% - it is better to select maximum performance.

[Don't recommend to enable it in Global Settings ⚡](https://preview.redd.it/7uis8x38j5ad1.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=35313796dc56c2a33d165ebbcb4d1a617d2a0396)

Same with Anisotropic filtering, it is not working (at all?) even with tweaks, you need to set it in **NVIDIA Control Panel**. **The improvement in texture quality will be tremendous**, there will be a million times less soap on textures.

**Remember that it resets after a driver update**.

And now, the sad part. I couldn't find some tweaks or values that would help increase shadow distance, as well as remove the weird haze interpretation, that appears when character stands high on a mountain.

I also tried not to use tweaks, in which it is necessary to set some different values, except for 0 or 1 or RAM / VRAM GB values, because they are hard to understand and it is very difficult to adjust them specifically for Wuthering Waves and other setups.

If you are going to test some parameters, please do it in batches so you know what to turn off if something goes wrong or the game stops starting / crashes / lagging and so on.

Want to remind, if you encounter any errors or problems - write in the comments, also, I will be very grateful if you try to solve it yourself, by finding a tweak that breaks the game or does not let you enter it, the quick solution is to simply delete Engine.ini, or remove all tweaks except the safe section, or put the first version of tweaks, which are at the beginning of this post.

Also if you're interested, Wuwa is on Unreal Engine 4.26.2.0.

reddit_search_1brwedo,An Examination of Wuthering Waves' Overworld Music,"Yes this is pretty much a direct response to a post about the OST on the front page. Yes it is bugging me THAT bad. My response is super long however, much longer than the original post, and so I think it warrants a post of its own. 

Wuthering Wave's open world music needs to change. Drastically so. It's not ""bad"" per se, but it is bland. This is just my personal inference from what I've read of WuWa's reception; I think the deficiency of WuWa's OST is subconsciously coloring player's perspective of other parts of the game negatively. All the complaints of ""dead world"" I think are actually complaints of ""dead OST"". The overworld has a decent enough mob density and some of them even interact with each other. Landscapes are pretty, change with world quests, and are no longer in grayscale since CBT2. So why do people think the world is pretty but sterile?

Looking back to some of the notable open world games in the past decade and a common factor in many of them is a very memorable OST.

[Skyrim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWtfo9kuRTU&t=999s)

[Witcher 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GYL6c_GTE0)

[Nier Replicant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qOvG9KeJ6c)

They are all such wonderous and melodic soundtracks that put the spirit of adventure and exploration in the player. A vital feeling to convey for an open world action ADVENTURE game.

Let's not forget open world games like [Cyberpunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSXcA6NUJ8s&list=PLDisKgcnAC4SqX0mi1J5_gd7-hrIS5yJp&index=4), [GTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJNwkJL7-fE&list=PLniAE5ZVzgJ72qmrW0BGgNzr2RspMx3Sg), and [Fallout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKTt2PoY6hQ&list=PLE9B1B519657DCF3E&index=4) will give you regular-ass songs, lyrics and all, and they are such a joy to listen to while traveling in the game. So its not correct to think open world games need to have a muted OST.

""But a lot of those are fantasy games. Of course they have a more melodic and instrument heavy sound track. WuWa is futuristic, it needs to be more electronic!"" 

Well...... How about comparing it to [Nier Automata](https://youtu.be/9zmhnGfwgWY?si=KrnhASUA9u9HTIFa&t=2433)? More specifically the part where your android player character enters a village of robots in an earth devoid of all human life. The song is still very melody heavy and even uses an acoustic guitar rather than an electric guitar. The only electronic portion is the lone synthesized voice amongst a group of actual children singing. 

In comparison, we have [Wuthering Waves](https://youtu.be/5JuiYBdbhc0?si=Od9bDVylhPinG-_L&t=2347). Take a moment to listen to the whole of track 16. Its a hodgepodge of different instruments that don't mesh well with each other. It is also at times its trying to create a brief melody and other times its trying to emulate a purely ambient sound track, ultimately resulting in something that doesn't feel cohesive nor is able to captures your attention. You can really tell that the producer had a hard time linking it all together, too, due to the multiple hard stops in the track. [Tracks 7,8, and 9](https://youtu.be/5JuiYBdbhc0?si=qcxN3LyAMiAibpwO&t=887) feel better to listen to but still falls into the same problem of alternating between trying to make a melody and then changing its mind part way through to focus on ambience. It feels disconnected, like 3 or 4 different 1 minute tracks spliced together.

A purely ambient sound track is also highly reliant on the other parts of a game to augment its emotive effect. The landscape, foley, and environmental sounds, the player's gameplay is critical to allow the ambient music to set the mood. So here is a [small section of WuWa gameplay](https://youtu.be/ojq3HhH_aqE?si=1JWU77t4h0XsU1-B&t=357) for context. And then [Elden Ring](https://youtu.be/LOBJGzP4DU8?si=4BEIwfyOXtnyvUXD&t=459). Or even better yet,[ STALKER](https://youtu.be/By1b2GLzDUA?si=lPCwVGbY8dElqtmX)

I think the vibe speaks for itself. WuWa's environment and gameplay are unable to by themselves carry the mood of the game. This is not a flaw in the game. Most games are unable to manage this because it takes meticulous and intentional planning. A constant coordination by all members of a development team to make sure the game has a unified and consistent direction. The constraints this places is often not feasible, especially in gacha games where the game's mood can swing quickly depending on what the player wants to do that day and where the game's setting is often only used as set dressing whenever the player isn't doing the main storyline. These games, WuWa included, requires its music to create the mood rather being left to augment the mood. And that's why I think Wuthering Waves needs to change its overworld music.

**AFTERWORD**

Just so I'm not completely negative, let me show examples of WuWa's ost that the rest of its overworld music should strive to be. [Tracks 5 and 6](https://youtu.be/5JuiYBdbhc0?si=rIkAofgVk29qTEYy&t=593). Like I said in my previous review, Kuro does seem to have the ability to make great music. But they really need to stop playing it safe and start really commiting hard to either making ambient music or memorable OST. And since we are way too late in development to retool the game to be suitable for an ambient soundtrack, the only option left is to make strong melodies and harmonies. 

Actually, there actually is a way to have both an ambient and melodic soundtrack and the best example I can give is once again Nier Automata. By splitting each song into its main melody, accompaniment, and vocals, and then dynamically layering and adding each part depending on the player's actions, Nier gets to have its cake and eat it too. But this is a level of cost and effort that really only the madman himself, Yoko Taro, is willing to undergo.... and Mica team with GFL Neural Cloud too for some reason (Jesus where do they find the money to finance these decisions)",90,33,1711843253.0,WutheringWaves,weaplwe,0.82,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1brwedo/an_examination_of_wuthering_waves_overworld_music/
reddit_search_1d3hdg3,My Honest Review of Wuthering Waves (FULL SPOILER),"After playing the game since Day 1 and until now, here's my honest review of the game(and yes, I've just created a reddit account to give my honest full review of the game):

The intro of the game is just a ripoff of Genshin and HSR's intro...heck, the only difference out here is that the player is wearing some chinese aesthetic outfit(does this mean the whole world is just a visualization of china but its the whole planet instead? that's rough), they don't have their own siblings just like HSR, and the big difference that I find is that they don't have a mascot companion on them(not until the final act but whatever), the way they wake up is just small difference from HSR's having the 2 same person along with them, aside from WuWa where its 2 girls instead of 1 girl and 1 man (so its already a harem game from the protagonist, not even bringing a single man along with them).

As for the story goes, its so rough at the start, all the people there just starts appreciating on Rover like a chosen one cliché, its so unrealistic just because they found someone lying on the ground and just eats up a crownless dude's echo, the only time the story got a little better is when the guy in red introduced himself and starts making a story for the protagonist, though its a bit lacking with just him teleporting the MC to a card dimension thing and then after that Yangyang is again on your sight after losing consciousness like if she can just get out of that card dimension why wait until the protag have to go fight a lot of enemies on that card dimension including Scar himself...

And then a character story is unlocked and its about Lingyang, his quest is so lame (though I appreciate the 2D dungeon angle they did) everything just leads to Lingyang being the creature that theyre looking for, even Lingyang's story all leads down to him in every way possible, just how dumb is everyone on that region to not piece it all together that he's the beast all along? it would already be even more obvious if its his old model but okay I guess.

Since I got story gated and need to increase my rank to progress, I started doing puzzles and farming echoes, the echoes feels like its gonna start to get worst later down the line due to how much time needed to even get those.

After I reach the next Story, I did some puzzle that doesn't even require to use my brain at all since everything has its quest points and all I need to do is just interact with them, just how small brain do you think the player base is just to make the puzzle to just interact stuff, at least give the players time to solve the puzzles for themselves... and then the Scar fight, its decent but I find the dialogue of Scar getting cutoff to a black image of him going to jail is outright hilarious, after that some talks and then the quest ends and then another story-gated that needs me to level up to 20+, what the heck? that main story is just too short just to give another story quest that's level-gated to much higher level, geez

  
After which, I continue completing quests, puzzles, farming echoes and more, and then some issues starts happening like music getting cut off and then after a few more minutes it just goes deaf, my attacks and character's voice doesn't even have a sound at all, I have to restart my whole game to fix that but it happens again just by teleporting...the stuttering is also unbearable too especially when fighting enemies in the wilderness, just how optimize is this game?

finally reached Act V of the game, Jiyan sure is cool from the start, and then for Rover they just did an Avenger's post which is so cringy and then they include the Blue bearded guy like I don't even know him at all yet! And why is Lingyang along with them on the battlefield when he is much better off being inside the village? I appreciate them for making them fight alongside the players but there's only like 3 - 4 sets of enemies out there, why cant they add more to make it even more enjoyable and this is the only time they did this shtick, what a bummer

Jiyan's coolness disappeared on my sight after he started praising Rover and makes HIM / HER do the strategy, like why though???? He is much more experienced for that as a GENERAL... so if the Rover failed is he gonna start blaming the Rover for his own f\*\*\* ups? that's just embarrassing.

  
Others said that the story starts to get better on Act 5 and 6 but I can't see the part where it starts to get better when its just full of Rover getting praised and strategizing of the battlefield...

  
Overall my opinion on the game is that its really lacking a lot on the story department and then the issues it has is just abysmal and the amount of grind needed on this game is just not good at all.

The things that I appreciate on the game though is the movements around the map and Scar for starting the story to be good (which starts the downfall even more after him being in jail), I appreciate them for giving us 10-limited pulls and a standard character selector but they're just damage control for the game and I won't fall for that.

reddit_search_1d178g5,Wuthering Waves Review #6969,"Hot takes incoming but hear me out.

**Story** – first impression on the story - **4/10**. After progressing - **9/10**.

>The developments were slow at first but over the past few days as I progressed through the story, I started getting more invested in the characters and the conflict between the protagonist’s side and the antagonist’s side rose higher and higher in terms of execution and stakes. Main nitpick – some content tend to get repeated multiple times and it kind of gets tiresome but that aside:  
>  
>I like that there are no clear good/evil sides in the story – there are both positive and negative characterizations within the MC and antagonist sides of the conflict. I have to say though that there are a few NPCs, although pretty minor roles, that kind of flipflop their allegiances and I don’t like that.  
>  
>Where I am in the story, I really like the antagonist and I hope they can develop the story in a way that makes the MC more interesting to play (just the cons of being self-insert, I guess). Edit: Agree with one of the comments below, the MC gets better when the antagonist is also present.

**Localization Quality** – **8/10**.

>The English version of the game is pretty good, but with caveats! My main nitpick is that it borrows too many words from the original CN version but it’s understandable since it’s a foreign game but that doesn’t really affect my enjoyment of the story much since some NPCs of the story are pretty good at explaining said terms/proverbs.  
>  
>Although I’ve heard that the dialogue in the CN version of the game is much better? From what I’ve seen, content in the Chinese side of the game has been pretty consistently spicier than the English version.

**Character Design** – **6/10**.

>Overall it’s either hit or miss but I appreciate the variety. MC design is pretty bland: only has 2 colors and the contrast looks dull while the antagonist is definitely more colorful and pleasing to look at, but it highly depends on your preference. Some like the maturity/grittiness of the MCs design, some don’t.  
>  
>From my POV though, I can definitely see more effort was put into designing one over the other, I hope the devs just cooked more with the MC design. I don't know why MC **looks like** the antagonist but I hope there's a lore explanation for it.  
>  
>Side characters are where the variety is at, but I don’t like that the NPCs are pretty much unrendered digital geometry, hell -- one question: why do some of the NPCs constantly have their mouths open like :O ??? I'm not a mouthbreather, I can't relate.

**Combat** – **9.5/10**.

>Combat is crisp and definitely one of the strongest points of the game alongside the story. Fights are very chaotic and fast-paced and feel very impactful. Story fights are amazing AND frequent; they are a spectacle to look at and occasionally have trolling or misinformation integrated into them which I find hilarious. I play mostly with mouse and keyboard and I never had any issues navigating around the the game menus and the open-world.

**Graphics/Artstyle** – **10/10.**

>This shit realistic as hell but I prefer the old UI.

**Music & SFX** – bgm nonexistent – **0/10**.

>Just queue your playlist in the background while you go through the story. However it's really weird because while playing the game I occasionally hear subtle SFX that resemble sniffing copium, which I find is **10/10**; it’s pristine. However, I decided to mute voiceover in the game because the NPC voices hurt my ears.

**TL;DR**

**WuWa arc rating:** **5-star selector/10.**

reddit_search_1futn7h,A Message From The Mods:,"Hello Rovers!

As your moderation team, we’ve been working on some changes to improve the subreddit and the community as a whole. Since these changes are significant, we wanted to take the time to announce them properly and address some concerns we’ve noticed behind the scenes.

# Rule Changes

**We’re adding 3 new rules, which will be visible on the sidebar:**

*New Rule 1: Zero-Tolerance on sexualization of Child-like Characters (Immediate Permaban)*

>Any sexualization, whether direct or implied, of child-like characters (e.g., loli characters) is strictly prohibited. This will result in a permanent ban, effective immediately. This is not up for discussion. **This rule has been added in with the previous Mature Content rule (rule 3).**

*New Rule 2: Tower of Adversity (ToA) and Events Showcase*

>All ToA-related posts must be more than simple screenshots of clears. Posts should serve as showcases that include one or more of the following:

>- The clear itself in a video format

>- The teams used to clear with full details on the units’ builds and/or strategies

>The goal is to create posts that provide value to the community, allowing others to give feedback or learn from your efforts.

>In-game event posts are also subject to removal at the discretion of moderators to maintain subreddit quality.

*New Rule 3: Doomposting*

>While we welcome criticism and will continue to allow it, doomposting will no longer be tolerated. Doomposting is excessive negativity or defeatist content that offers no constructive feedback or meaningful discussion. It aims to spread unnecessary negativity and disrupts the community atmosphere. This rule will likely affect a small group of individuals, but it has become necessary to maintain a positive and productive space for the rest of the community.

**Additionally, some rules have been combined for clarity, and due to Reddit's limits on sidebar space and character count:**

*Combined Previous Rules: 5 Titles + 11 Flairs -> Post Titles & Flairs:*

>**Titles**: Titles must accurately reflect the submission content, be clear, concise, and properly capitalized. Use spoiler tags when necessary, as per spoiler rules. Clickbait and spoilers in titles are prohibited.

>**Flairs**: All posts must be correctly flaired based on the Flair Overview, or they may be removed. Users can assign personal flairs with icons, emojis, and text, but flair content must be appropriate and follow subreddit guidelines.

*Combined Previous Rules: 13 English + 14 Subreddit Quality -> Subreddit Quality & Language*

>**English**: All posts, comments, and discussions must be in English to maintain inclusivity and accessibility for all members. Non-English content may be removed.

>**Subreddit Quality**: Low-effort content, such as generic topics, unedited reactions, simple screenshots, and reposts, is discouraged. Moderators will use discretion to ensure post quality. Crossposts are subject to moderator review for relevance and quality before approval.

*Combined Previous Rules: 12 Terms of Service and User Agreement + 15 Third Party Tools -> Terms of Service and User Agreement*

>**Terms of Service**: All content must comply with Reddit’s User Agreement, Kuro Games’ Terms of Service, and Wuthering Waves Fair Play Policy. Unauthorized third-party programs, cheating tools, and selling or sharing game accounts are prohibited. 

>**Third-Party Tools**: The usage of any third-party tools shared here is done so at your own risk. By using them, you accept full responsibility for any consequences. The subreddit and its members disclaims any liability for issues arising from their use.

**As always, you can find the full set of rules here and in the sidebar:**  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/wiki/rules/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/wiki/rules/)

# [PLEASE READ] Some things we’d like to address as well:

**Regarding Leaks**

Simply put, leaks are not allowed here in any way shape or form. There are other places for that (like where you’re finding them), but this is not one of them. We’ve seen all the ""creative"" ways people try to mention leaks—please just don’t bother, you will get in trouble.

Recently, well in honesty for a little while now, there’s been a significant rise in leak discussions, and we can no longer simply remove posts and give warnings. This was our original method for handling leaks, but since the message wasn’t heard we’ve shifted tactics. Here on out, any mention of leaks will result in an immediate temporary ban. Repeated bans will increment in time or may even result directly in a permanent ban. This isn't a change we’re thrilled about, but it’s necessary to maintain our community standards and our verbal warning method was ineffective. Please respect the rules and avoid talking about leaks here.

**Arguments and Civility**

There are a lot of arguments happening these days, and they’re all quite frankly meaningless. Neither party in these arguments wants to shift from their position, thus by definition are no longer having a discussion, and are simply just venting their frustrations at one another caused by one another. If you’re in a discussion and realize the other person isn’t open to changing their viewpoint, save yourself the trouble—just walk away. Don’t escalate things into arguments. It’s unhealthy, and at the end of the day, it accomplishes nothing.

Avoid any name-calling, demeaning, or discrediting of others and their opinions. If you need to, simply say, ""It seems neither of us are willing to change our stance, so there’s no further discussion to be had. Have a nice day,"" and move on. Engaging in uncivil behavior, no matter who started it, will lead to consequences for all involved. Keep the peace and don’t let discussions devolve.

**A Final Note**

As your moderation team, we’re genuinely happy to be part of this community and are dedicated to making it a positive and welcoming space for everyone. We’re volunteers doing this in our free time, and we rely heavily on you—the community—to keep things running smoothly. Your feedback, reports, and participation are crucial in building a strong, supportive subreddit. While some changes may take time as we follow our process, please know that your input is always appreciated and taken into consideration.

Thank you for being part of this journey with us!",743,292,1727910428.0,WutheringWaves,GoblinBurgers,0.86,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1futn7h/a_message_from_the_mods/

reddit_search_1cz7986,[Review] Wuthering Waves Expectations - Positively Surprised! ,"Noticed that a lot of people are unhappy with the game, some reasons more acceptable than others, but since I got pleasantly surprised by the game, I thought I could list a few things that I liked (*and disliked*) about the game. This is not my opinion, but objective facts, and whoever disagrees is wrong.

**Liked:**

* Expected good **Combat** and I got it, somewhat. I can see the potential, but the current roster of characters is just not it. All of them seem so basic and they explore so little of the game's mechanics. Hopefully, as we get new characters, new mechanics are used in conjunction with their kits in a more fluid way.
* **Movement** in this game is better than average but is not as fluid. The wall running is really weird, and for some reason, you can't jump off walls! (*absolutely unforgivable*)
* I was not excited for **Echoes**, but holy shit, they are fun! To use, to upgrade, the whole system seems like the most complete and fleshed out aspect of the game (*VERY good thing*)
* The **Graphics** are GORGEOUS. I have a pretty decent machine and run pretty much everything maxed. I can guarantee you that every unskippable dialogue or so, I stop and just look at the character models (*The Rover and Jinshi scene is jaw-droppingly gorgeous*). This was one of my biggest concerns for the game, and I am so happy they got it right!
* The **Gacha** is nuts. Guaranteed five-star weapons perma is already bonkers, but starting the game with double five-star and you get to pick one (*technically two if you reroll*) is the best gacha you can get in the market for this type of game, hands down. (*And the five-star weapon picker, seriously these guys must hate money*)

**Disliked:**

* The current **Story and Narrative** kinda suck ass. Like, no joke, I just did not give a single f during the ENTIRE first few chapters of the main quest, It got a lil better but not much. Too much exposition and everyone was just too nice for no reason (*or just straight-up hypocritical like Scar*). It looked like we were some politician that was visiting the area. I expected this from Kuro; they can make a good story, but telling it doesn't seem like their forte.
* Some of the **UI Elements and their Typography** look bad. The good thing is, it's not as a whole. The UI for Echoes, Weapons, and Such looks good, but the health bar, the skill descriptions, item descriptions look so weird. It looks like either the game's font doesn't have an option other than **bold** or the devs just forgot that's a thing. And WHY is the Resonance Liberation Indicator for the off-field characters a MINISCULE CHECK on the screen? No glow? Not even a bigger indicator? I didn't even know it was there until I saw someone point it out in a video!

**Don't Care or Didn't Affect Me:**

* No **Connectivity** or **Performance** problems. The game dc'd once after I went biking for an hour. The game runs fine and looks great (*i7 9th gen with RTX 2060 supa*).
* **Translation** honestly does not bother me. I am a skipper tho, so that could be a reason for it.

Honestly, this launch makes me hopeful. The product is good, but we WILL see a player decline, not sure how big tho. The game is in better shape compared to Genshin's launch, the current big daddy of the genre, and I honestly think it just looks objectively better and the combat has much more depth. Since this project is pretty much Kuro's all-in, I expect them to keep the great communication and player-driven structure they got going on, and if this is the case, this game's future is guaranteed to be hella bright.

Y'all can be happy because this can surely become a great gem of the genre just like Hoyo's works!",17,17,1716507994.0,WutheringWaves,old_mrcat,0.59,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cz7986/review_wuthering_waves_expectations_positively/

reddit_search_1drs0go,Kuro cooked and my respect for Rover increased. 1.1 is Easy 9/10 for me.,"I liked the story since the start as many of my posts here already shown. Liked the main story, liked the side quest and liked the exploration quests (Still salty about losing my fire flowers field).
But anyways. Though I liked 1.0. I could readily admit the story pacing had many flaws and so I dreaded 1.1 wondering what would happen.

Kuro cooked. 

Like damn. Just finished 1.1 and I am Still feeling giddy and so my talk about Rover.


Now in this 1.1. Rover play both as a side character to Jinshi but also as the most important key for Jinshi development. 

Since 1.0 we knew that Rover was some kind of Messhia who came every time the world was in Danger.  Not unlike the Counter Force in Fate. This was kinda my vision of them. Basically the Emiya Shiro of Wuthering wave. Only more cracked. 

  
Now though it seems like I really need to change my opinion  because holy fuck.

https://preview.redd.it/aumls080jm9d1.jpg?width=3056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa9b6691430c7899693e905e3aa0335ae9be1d89

I did not expect this. Well, I kinda started understanding when Jue called her Arbiter. But damn. I didn't think it was to this extent. At most I thought she was equal to those gods. Not their literal boss lol.

People thought Jue was the Zhongli of Wuthering wave when it was Rover all along lol. In a way, You could say Rover is the Heavenly Principle of Wuwa. (Sorry for all the Genshin comparisons. I love the two games. )

Honestly now I have so many questions. 

Like how strong is Jinshi now? She inherited Jue power but I doubt she inherited all of it in one go. 

How strong was Rover at their peak. A wounded,  tired, at doorsteps Jue could literally freeze time of an entire island. Imagine Peak jue and now Imagine the fact that Jue was basically Rover's pet.😅😅

Finally, does Rover have authority over all the gods or only Jue? 

  
Anyway I am super excited. Abby was great. I am kinda sad its appeared in flash and vanished.  I am intrigued by it. I am sad Chixia and Yangyang didn't get much screentime but this wasn't their stories. 

I feel in love with Jinshi all over. Seeing a young woman shoulder so much responsibility is inspiring.  I am definitely in love with Changli. She was epic.

I am no reviewer. My opinion is entirely subjective but This whole 1.1 story was a easy 9/10 for me. I am leaving 1 point because nothing is perfect. I do think Jue and Jinshi repeated their discussion a little too much. 

  
I don't know what they are going to cook in 1.2 but now I am even more scared lol. The higher the anticipation the greater the disappointment after all..

See you all.

Gameplay is also fun, with its fast pace and skill requirement, which makes me more invested in getting good at the core combat mechanics like dodging and parrying.

The one huge issue I have with the game, which took 2 points from my rating, is how it keeps on crashing.
I even turned down some graphics settings, to make it easier, and I don’t know if that made it better or worse, because I keep on crashing. I haven’t even done much in the story, barely any exploration, and I only have the four characters that the game basically gives to you, and I am already considering just not playing the game simply because it seems like the game doesn’t want me to play it.",0,6,1716474335.0,WutheringWaves,ArtistInAVoid,0.29,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cyu2eb/my_review_of_wuthering_waves_810/

reddit_search_1has5vq,[REVIEW] Infinity Nikki: the princessoulslike of gacha games,"Hello, hello, helloooo! Here I come with a -- kinda late -- review of Infinity Nikki. I only had time to properly play it this weekend (have in mind I'm a mobile player), so please, even if you think you've read a lot about the 5th game in the Nikki franchise, just smile and wave.

Another 2024 release for *Infold Games* (aka Paper Games), and after the immense success of [Love and Deepspace](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/19a4pzk/review_first_impressions_of_love_and_deepspace/), I can see another huge gacha hit for the female audience, and if it doesn't top my [female-oriented chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1h458yn/november_2024_revenue_husbando_femaleoriented/) for December, it'll sure be top 3. I think everyone knows at this point, but it's important to inform those out of the loop: the game is an open world game with a huge focus on dressing up and platforming. 

[The cutscenes are breathtaking.](https://preview.redd.it/9h8mm9355x5e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc53bd6beddb0923a84b03757c4ee758096f924a)

# FIRST IMPRESSIONS

Once again, *Infold* was able to deliver an almost flawless launch: despite some ""reconnecting"" instances (potentially for being in South America when servers are probably in the US), I haven't read any issue. No server capacity, no lag, blackscreens, nothing. The bugs are there, but the most common one has a in-game solution (the ""unstuck character"" option).

[Lettuce\/chromakey Momo \(using a blue fairy cape\) was the only bug I've found.](https://preview.redd.it/gponpxes5x5e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=124a5d1890669b386e9c8992cbc76ad9ce8fb3d7)

Other than that, the game runs surprisingly smooth on Medium (with resolution and a details on High), and I say that because the only other prominent experience I had with Unreal Engine in gachas was a disaster: *Wuthering Waves* heated my Snapdragon 8+ Gen1 on Medium and the stuttering was insane. On the other hand, IN asks for newer processors, but it runs smoothly if you can meet the requirements and the only issues are delayed rendering in some real-time cutscenes (something I'm quite used to in Genshin, Star Rail and other gachas).

While the graphics on mobile aren't the best due to obvious limitations, everything I've seen from PC gameplays was amazing, and if you can play it on PS5 or PC, do it! If I was positively surprised on mobile, I can't imagine how it'd be to play Nikki's adventure with Momo (her cute cat companion) for the first time with high/ultra graphics.

Before getting into the gameplay, another praise: character design and models! What a breath of fresh air is being able to see people with actual beards and wrinkles, and clothes that aren't a piece of paper with drawn textures.

[Sword-wielding women, gotta be one of my favorite genders.](https://preview.redd.it/1ngyhmo67x5e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a2c6d249411dc48710b22b7ee32eac3b0e55161)

\---

# STORY

Currently, I've finished chapter 3 of the main story and have done some side quests and 2 world quests. And I might confess: the story is WEAK. Like, really weak. The writing just isn't there and the dialogues are all over the place (at least in English). Nikki has been transported to another dimmension, apparenly, with her loyal companion Momo. She's looking for the Miracle Outfits, apparently overpowered clothes that are capable of winning whatever they want to wing (a dark force that created the enemies, aka Esselings), and all the usual gacha drill...

Tbf, it's not bad BAD, but it's ignorable imo, extremely shallow, but there are some really cute and fluffy dialogues, specially in the few sidequests I've completed. Not really a lot of worldbuilding, but at the same time the game tries to shove some terms without really exploring them and binding them together. Characters don't matter a lot, and all the drama is really superficial. Take this laughable dialogue of a bad guy realizing his parents are the issue in two lines as an example (Nikki is more efficient than 10 therapy sessions!):

[Well, I think I rest my case with this.](https://preview.redd.it/etybn4lxqx5e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1341fc999fa6ddf43bf442617bd3986c266a89a)

\---

# GAMEPLAY

Well, diving into the gameplay, I can say that the dress up part ticks all my boxes and scratches all my itches. I used to play Love and Shining Nikki, the previous 2 games in the Nikki franchise, but couldn't handle the monetization. It's just amazing to match pieces from different outfits after you have dozens of pieces of clothing, and while there is some clipping, it's honestly expected, mainly when there's so much movement (and something present on Shining Nikki, the first 3D Nikki game). But the fabrics look amazing, I've seen pics around and like, even the knitting was very detailed when playing on PC. Oh, and the clothes are used for fashion ""battles"", where you have to meet requirements of attributes like ""cool"", ""elegant"", ""sexy"" etc.

One aspect that's been grown on me over the last couple of days is the platforming: the game has NO climbing! And it's by far my favorite part and the mechanic I miss the less. It's also a great way to differentiate the game from the other gachas in the open world realm. Other stuff from open worlds out there are here, but they're different enough in my opinion, and ""floating"" (kinda like gliding, but that term is used for a longer floating later in the game) is really brief, not allowing you to ""cheat"" when the devs intended for you to actually have a little challenge.

Riding a bike, a giant bird, a paper crane and even the tail of a catapult seal (yes, like the animal) complete the movement around the world. And while you might think the no-climbing aspect might limit the game, it honestly creates space for the trampolines, air currents and other devices to shine. Movement is definitely not a issue, and teleport waypoints are also a thing to save your time.

[Tsuriding...](https://preview.redd.it/jwk46tzvbx5e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c2e1447c8ed937aedc611bc480dd407eb97ce8d)

Speaking of things meant to save your time, collecting whim stars (the equivalent of occuli in Genshin) has an ""alarm"" where Momo tells you there's a star nearby, and you can track it. Collecting materials is also really easy, and you can mark small areas with the materials you've discovered already, and after you collect a certain number of them (50 iirc), you can mark their exact locations. --Best part of collecting materials, though?? YOU CAN PET THE DOG! But not only the dog, you also pet/groom the cats, the ferrets, the goats, the horses and even the freaking birds!!! 10/10 game, no need to have anything else.

Oh, and after the brief comic relief, one last great aspect of the gameplay before I \~\~talk shit about the game\~\~ analyze some negative points: it's not extra easy! But also not extremely hard... And it's honestly something I would never expect from a female-oriented game. But yeah, you can challenge yourself, specially on some platforming challenges and minigames around the world. And the minigames are plenty: bicycle race, hopping through the map, gliding through rings, target practice and even thimblerig are examples of the huge variety of (mostly optional) challenges scattered throughout the beautiful landscapes.

Well, we've arrived at the negative points, and honestly it's not a lot, but obviously not everything is perfect. The first thing I'm gonna talk about is a bit nitpicky, but still... The repetitiveness of collecting whim stars is a bit too much after I've collected almost 200 of them... Yeah, there are a lot on launch, and some of them require you to do some puzzling, but the puzzles are often very simple and a bit too repetitive, specially the ones where you have to light up over a dozen of boxes by floating from one to the other (and trying not to fall). The duality for me is: while I really love that there's diversity in the challenges, entering a timewarp-y room every couple of minutes to do a challenge is kinda meh.

The last thing I'm gonna complain about (and my least favorite aspect of the game) is the combat... It's way too simple, and while I genuinely enjoyed the couple boss batles I've experienced, having only a magic ball is very limiting, and at least a sword or a close-ranged hit would be appreciated. The auto-aim is also really poor on mobile (for instance, aiming backwards or towards the sides often won't lock into an enemy), and manual aim is probably only for the PC (and maybe the controller) players. But at the end of the day battling is the smallest part of the game, so it's not like it makes it any less interesting.

[The first boss fight \(quite interesting imo\).](https://preview.redd.it/9dmismdqex5e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bda6c4dc65fb96d59ab7f964d1a5a5ca723bf54e)

\---

# TAKING PICTURES

I just had to highlight my 2nd favorite aspect of the game (1st is dressing up, of course): the camera! Well, not only you can take pictures, but there's also a button on-screen to take snapshots of the screen without the UI elements. But that aside (which is a cool thing), the camera itself is very well done. Seriously well done. Besides being able to move the angle and where the camera is located, and focusing on Nikki's face, removing NPCs and all the stuff you might be used to in other open world games, you can also rotate Nikki's body, for instance.

But the editing menu is where the camera shines: you can adjust brightness, contrast, put on filters, but the most mindblowing feature to me is being able to control the lens aperture (only works on higher settings). Oh, and you can also take vertical pictures by rotating the camera. It's something you'll probably spend several minutes every time you see a cool landscape.

[Looking good & feelin' fine.](https://preview.redd.it/hh5qkxqufx5e1.jpg?width=852&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b0be3bf816a84e0155320453fbcb8af9191fe2)

Well, also related to pictures but not exactly to the camera, and which is the reason this review has the perhaps nonsense title you've read... There's a neat feature where you see some lamps with snapshots from other users, and you can like them or take a duo picture with their Nikki, dressed up just like in the photo another user has taken! One of the best social features I've seen implemented in a gacha, and after you unlock it, you can also post your pictures for others to see.

[This screenshot could easily be from Elden Ring, you can't tell the difference.](https://preview.redd.it/3pgsrb2mgx5e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=977315b46432d3d6cd56ab690b0943269af7c22e)

# GACHA AND MONETIZATION

Yup, we've arrived to my most ""I just wanna shit on Infold Games"" section, so brace yourselves! In preparation to my truckful of complaints: please understand I've played *Mr. Love: Queen's Choice* for at least half a year, *Love Nikki* for almost the same time, *Shining Nikki* for a month, and *Love and Deepspace* for a couple of months (between installing and uninstalling it)... So yeah, while I'm gonna make a lot of futurology in the next paragraphs, please understand I've played most of games developed by Paper Games, and I have reasons for my concerns.

Just a sum up of the gacha before anything: pulls cost 120 gems, 1200 for 10x, there's paid and free currency, the whole ""2024 gacha package"". Every 20 pulls you get a 5\* piece, and most limited outfits have 9 pieces; the pieces don't repeat until you get a full set. So hard pity is around 180 pulls (it might be more, or even less, for instance: pity would be 200 pulls for an outfit with 10 pieces). After you've pulled the outfit once, you can pull it once more to get its evolution (a totally different color, sometimes small details like lace patterns might also change).

After you've pulled 20 times up to 100 times, you get the 5 pieces of make up from that set, and going forward unlocks other cosmetics, like avatar borders and Momo capes, besides Heartshine, a material for other evolutions (these 5\* outfits usually have 4 colors, and 2 of them come from using 1 Heartshines, with the final recolor needing dupes of the pieces). You can also target a specific piece of the outfit you want, and it'll be guaranteed when you pull 5 pieces of said outfit (just so the dress doesn't come as the last piece, for instance -- a very real drama that happens to a lot of us who've played other Nikki games).

First and foremost: yes, the launch is amazing! Everything is a field full of flowers, you'll be able to pity one of the first 2 limited banners and you'll get a full standard banner set in no time as well... But that's due to the release bonuses, of course. Yes, we still have to see how good (or bad) the pull income will be with events and new areas being released, so another warning: my concerns expressed below are purely based on the dev's previous games.

[Another cute pic to warm your \(potentially\) rage-y hearts for the following content.](https://preview.redd.it/3la0mcshix5e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5633400f3787c2063ef889b7165d8f92f3bff1)

Let's be honest: the game already shows it can be quite greedy. Seriously, I know it's just released, but let's face it: 2 limited banners on release, there are free limited pulls with expiration date already (something Infold implemented first in Love and Deepspace), and there are 4 limited-time paid-only outfits, a 1st top up bonus outfit and another 5 paid-only standard ones (so a total of 10 paywalled outfits already... ON LAUNCH!!!... and 2 of them, the most expensive ones at $15 and $50, you have the option of buying a second time in order to get a recolor/evolution, meaning they can cost $30 and $100, respectively).

If that's not enough for you, paywalling cards and outfits is already an extremely common practice for the devs, and Mr. Love and the other 2 Nikki games have plenty of time-limited top up ""bonuses"" where you have to top up $100+ to get the best reward (and in the Nikki games the outfits are really intricate in order to inflict a lot of FoMO). Yeah, it's not an uncommon thing among gachas, but I'm just here trying to warn people, specially gacha newbies and female players that mightn't know too much about gachas, coming from games that aren't as exploitative, that Infold is low when it comes to their gachas.

Just to give people some insight: I've played Love and Deepspace for 2 months after its release, and among 13 limited cards with bunners running back-to-back and in a really rushed schedule (only 10 days for solos and 14 days for banners with 3 cards), I was able to get only one 5\* card. On the 14th banner, I got my second limited card, and only because I've won 50/50 (which at least this Nikki game doesn't have). So yeah, don't expect to get even half the limited outfits as an f2p, perhaps not even 20% of them. Oh, and we still have to see how it goes, but other Nikki games have the ""hell events"", where you spend a big amount of gems in order to get more limited outfits, so if that's the case for the future of IN, these hell events will potentially be the best ways to spend the pulling currency.

[Yup, I've bitten the hook \(this is a $1 outfit\).](https://preview.redd.it/v7vypk4cpx5e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee039c2e2f9c99350a6e4cd4fc8c6809e6417429)

\---

# FINAL THOUGHTS

Yeah, I can say I really liked the game, and I really hope I'm wrong with my predictions about the monetization becoming greedier and greedier. But the game is solid, it's mostly a 7.5/10 for me, and I'll probably keep playing it to see what else Infold has in their pockets. I really hope they make some good events for Infinity Nikki, and hopefully the gacha frequency isn't as unforgiving as their other games.

Even if the game has some weak spots, namedly the story and the combat (maybe, for some it might be good), I think the gameplay is good enough for most people, and definitely a must-try for everyone who enjoys open worlds, but wants something different than the usual post-Genshin attempts.

[Cuteness all over the place!](https://preview.redd.it/cygex2x6sx5e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=faeba5f13cd4a34cabd35a1a241a8b9c3d2403c1)

\---

# TL;DR

\- Game looks good, but not that much on mobile;

\- Clean launch with only a few bugs;

\- Story is the weakest part of the game, the worldbuilding is poor, but it has its cute moments;

\- Gameplay is varied, lots of mechanics and minigames, but battle is really simple;

\- Dressing up is extremely fun and a big part of the game;

\- Camera is a highlight and really complex, you'll lose a lot of time in it;

\- Gacha is okay-ish, but the dev's history is worryful;

\- It'll probably be another success by Infold Games.

reddit_search_1iv56fv,Review story 2.1 it was perfect,"I've never laughed this much in a gacha game this is a first.

Yeah, sure, you could call it ""filler"" or whatever, but honestly, who cares?

The most important thing is telling a good story. And beyond the story itself, this was a real adventure full of laughs, discoveries, and attachants moments with the characters (Brant, Phoebe, Rover, Abby, Zani), all without feeling heavy.

We've come a long way. ""Remember when we criticized the game for its lack of character interactions and adventure with reason. But since version 2.0, that issue is gone, and honestly, that a good thing.

What makes this adventure so amazing is really the event itself. Sailing around bringshow should I put it a breath of fresh air. You're there, living the adventure, the music fits perfectly, and it really sets the mood for being out at sea.

I loved every second of it, I'm literally writing this with a big smile on my face, lol. I need more moments like this

The moments that stood out to me:

• Starbuck, the MVP lol  He kept being hilarious all the way to the end.

• Brant: He had a short appearance, but just seeing him act like a true captain, sailing through the waves... I loved it. (Makes me want to rewatch Pirates of the Caribbean 3 with my guy Captain Barbossa, lol.)

• Phoebe: A fantastic character she questions herself, doesn’t just sit back and let things happen, and always does her best. That moment when she apologized to the whale? Too cute.

The moment she explained how she uses her bonk to purify echoes But Rover and Zani thought she was joking. Then she said, ""No, it wasn’t a joke, I’m serious."" The silence that followed was just too funny! Phoebe didn’t know where to put herself, and damn, it was funny.

• Abby: Once again, he proves he’s the star  Whether it’s in JP or EN, the voice actors clearly love playing this character When he imitated the whale, I was crying from laughter. I love him so much.

• Rover: No complaints, he’s exactly the protagonist he thinks he is. That moment when he shouted ""Get out of there!"" at Phoebe actually caught me off guard. Other than that, I still don’t get how people can hate him he’s incredible, he’s showing more of his personality, and that’s awesome.

• Zani: Her interactions with Phoebe were absolute gold. That panic moment on the train: ""Oh Sentinel, protect us."" ""Phoebe, would you pray for me? It’s only been four months since I last went to church."" That was hilarious, and she’s just so easy to get attached to. Zani is best girl. I can’t wait to see more of her.

Now, I really hope we get a more personal storyline for Phoebe moving forward.

Overall, this was perfect for me. I just can’t wait for what’s next.

And what about you? Did you enjoy this adventure and this little side story?

reddit_search_1gffou7,Sharing suggestions for the survey...,"**Important/needed features:**
- Implement 2FA for better account security. 
- Add missing languages like PT and RU based on the countries that play the game. 
- Need to solve performance issues on mobile and optimize the game for low end devices, it has improved since launch but still needs work.
- Fix the audio desync with certain cutscenes.
- Customer support doesn't answer via email.
- To ascend new characters, players are currently required to wait until the end of the story to unlock the necessary boss, which isn't a good experience, especially for new players. I suggest introducing a limited-time shop where players can buy the boss material using waveplates while the character's banner is active. The shop would only offer enough materials to unlock inherent skills (level 70 iirc) and would cost slightly more than fighting the boss directly.
- STAIRS of Adversity (ToA) need a lot of work: 
• When we select ""LEAVE"" while in battle, take the player to the screen when we enter the tower, instead of kicking us out the tower, down the stairs (it is inconvenient because slowly loads the open world).
• By fixing the ""LEAVE"" button, the ""Adjust the lineup"" toggle in the ""Challenge Failed"" screen is redundant, so either remove it or make it a 3rd button and also show it when we pause without dying.
• Remove enviroment report notice, we can see it before we enter the floor and is annoying if we have to restart many times.
• Timers and challenge goals should be in the same format, preferably in minutes.
• When using controller and triggers the ""Challenge Failed"" screen, make the default option to be ""challenge again"" to match the default option when we pause.
• When we restart we have to walk to the center for no reason and the loading screen seems to take too long, probably can be optimized.
;Less important/optional: ------------------->¡
• Let us change equipment inside the tower.
• It would be nice to have some kind of sound that trigger when we hit each time goal. 
• Add a ""save and challenge again"" button after finishing a floor without getting max stars.
• Maybe a redesign in the outside to make it look like a tower.
• Show the damage number that kills the last enemy.
• Add more objectives beyond killing enemies in x amount of time. Some ideas would be tower defense, surviving x amount of time, dodging and/or parrying x times, not getting more than x hits.
- Bring back the Crownless cutscenes from CBT1, it would improve the story and battle as the current ones feel underwhelming. Originally, the boss attacked and seriously injured the characters, giving Rover a strong and personal reason to fight. Now, it's been reduced to mild headaches, which removes the depth and urgency, making it feel like there’s nothing at stake. Additionally, when Rover absorbs the Echo, there’s no sound effect and the camera angle is weaker. 
- Fully voicing Rover in important scenes would make the experience much more immersive. Version 1.2 handled this very well, but 1.3 was a noticeable step back, missing voice acting in key moments and breaking immersion with single-option dialogues. These one-option dialogues disrupt the flow and feel unnecessary. They'd be better as voiced lines. Dialogue options should appear when there are meaningful choices and different outcomes, creating a smoother, more engaging experience overall.
- Avoid making every character immediately overly friendly with Rover. This approach has already become repetitive, predictable, and is unrealistic. Letting connections develop gradually would create more authentic and engaging dynamics. Show more character interactions. Currently, characters rarely engage with each other, which limits the depth of their relationships and the world-building.
- Matchmaking for Forgery Challenges take too much time. A solution could be to include all difficulties for a quicker match. The difficulty used should be the average of the selected LV from the 2/3 players, but rewards remain the same the player selected. Also if there is a restriction for using the same character in this mode, remove it.

**Other suggestions and QoL:**
- Implement a feature to delete past mission data to free up space. This will help keep the game size reasonable, especially as more content is added over time.
- When downloading the game for the first time ask the player wich voice language to use, instead of using ENG as default. 
- Implement generic variations of base skin for every character (like PGR).
- Improve the UI for PC, it looks too much like a mobile game, we dont need so many buttons on the screen, give us the option to hide everything except the map when exploring and only show relevant icons when in combat (like Elden Ring).
- When characters in the story are supposed to go with Rover to a place, make them follow us in the world. It would significantly enhance the immersion.
- Implement Guild system (like PGR).
- Implement a way to replay cutscenes.
- Implement an option to review dialogue and voice lines (like PGR).
- Show the subtitles of the character voice lines while in combat, exploring, idle and in the menu.
- Mini map fixed or rotational option.
- Option to remove and customize damage number's size (like PGR).
- Bring back the messages shared across worlds from the CBT1 (like souls games).
- Make a normal/different clock or bring it back from CBT1, the current one is overdone.
- At the end of a co-op session show the damage dealt by each player and the MVP (like PGR).
- Implement a leaderboard in Tower of adversity with rewards depending on % ranking (like PPC in PGR).
- Make the Piano in Black Shores an actual piano we can play at will.
- Add customization options for the visual of Rover. Quest items and Cherished items could be used as accessories to give those an actual use.
- The sumarize feature when we skip the story would be more useful for side quests.
- Add a training dummy.
- Customization freedom to select a different language for each character.
- Make the camera shake setting low by default.
- Special rewards on birthday.
- Implement endgame mode focused on enemy waves (like Warzone from PGR).
- Option to Enable/Disable Sequences.
- Provide complete control over controller button mapping. Currently, some buttons are locked and cannot be changed, which affects muscle memory, especially for players who also play other games. This also happens with Mouse and Keyboard with options like Yohuo QTE.
- Make big limited time events like the 1.2 festival available for new players, without the limited rewards.
- Characters should appear and be interactable in the the open world, making it feel more alive (Like Shorekeeper). 
- Add mimic chests and other kind of loot, like abandoned cars, fridges, etc.
- Add Easter eggs from popular games.
- Adding some kind of weekly activity would give more reasons to play instead of just the dailies and events. 
- Optional ""EX Malding"" world-tier difficulty with better material drops.
- Endgame/Event mode idea: content that focuses on not getting touched at all. You have 1 hp and if 1 attack touches you, you die. You can only bring 1 character. You will be fighting a boss that have tricky fast attacks. This boss have 2000 HP but your attack cannot damage it, every dodge deals 5 damage, every parry deals 20 damage. ◇ Stylish parry is rewarded with more damage: Basic/charge attack parry = 20 damage. Skill parry = 30 damage. Ultimate parry = 40 damage. Plunge attack parry = 45 damage. Intro skill parry = 50 damage. You are rewarded based on how much HP left on the boss when you die, and max reward is killing the boss.  
- Give the intimacy voice lines some use.
- New enemy mechanics: projectile parry would be nice.
- Real animation to pet animals.
- Being able to synthesize anywhere.",360,162,1730267329.0,WutheringWaves,TopCustomer3294,0.92,https://reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1gffou7/sharing_suggestions_for_the_survey/

reddit_search_1kp4gqa,My thoughts on girlcott and why we NEED to succeed,"First of all, I want to say that I love all of you queens, and I'm proud of you for making this subreddit not only magical but also a place for open discussion. Personally, I only use Reddit to get memes for my meme group and see the news on the games I like, but I wanted to post this to show my appreciation and support for the girlcott and offer some suggestions.

I am a day one player who loves this game with all my heart. It is rare to see a game for a female audience that is made with such love and attention to detail. And I would like for this game to be successful for many years.

As someone who lives in a semi-open dictatorship in the middle of Europe, and who is fighting actively against it and has useful interests for this topic (psychology, sociology, philosophy, and a bit on social economy), I think I may have some knowledge on how to fight for your rights.

\---------------------------------------------------------

In my personal opinion, we need to focus on just a few (2 or 3) demands that have to be met by infold/papergames, and we need to stay united if we want any chance of succeeding. I will list ones that I think are the most important ones, and I will elaborate why:

1. Our first and biggest demand should be a standard ""hard pity"" for all 5-star outfits. The way the gacha system functions is fundamental for any gacha game (especially for bigger gacha games that are competing or are at the same level as Genshin) and can't be changed every 5 or 6 months. Changing hard pity for a specific 5-star outfit is essentially changing the way gacha functions.

If a game, like for example Genshin (as that game set most of the rules for modern gacha games), changed its ""hard pity"" for a specific character (let's say it is the upcoming character Skirk) from 180 wishes to 220 and tried to justify it with excuses like ""we put so much effort into designing her and her animations"", there would be such a backlash and unrest in the playerbase that our gilrcott would look like a childsplay compared to it.

The most reasonable demand would be 180 pulls for a whole 5-star outfit. That is a standard amongst big gacha games, to which Infinity Nikki definitely belongs. It is true that we have somewhat more favorable terms (120 diamonds for 1 pull), but when you consider that in most games it is theoretically possible to get a limited 5-star character in a 10-pull (it happened to me in Honkai Star Rail twice, in Genshin never) and something like that is literally impossible in Nikki (11 pieces), I think 180 hard pity is favorable for both sides. If you consider that you get the first evolution at 180 pulls, it would be, mildly said, paradoxical to get first evolution before the whole outfit (which you need in order to use the evolution). In my opinion, Nikki was at first designed to have only up to 9 pieces for 5-star outfits (which would explain the 180 pulls evolution), and was later changed to 10 pieces for the ""Blooming Dreams"" outfit.

I have never played Shining Nikki, but I have heard a lot of stories about it from you on this subreddit and as well as from YouTubers like Evie Gaming, and from what I have heard, my opinion is that Papergames will try to replicate the model from that game and try to constantly increase the pieces for 5-star outfits every once in a while (perhaps half a year). That model can be tolerable (although not fair) for a smaller mobile-only gacha game like Shining Nikki, but it is not acceptable for a big game like Infinity Nikki, which has to compete with similar big games like Genshin, Stair Rail, Wuthering Waves, and cetera. No other big gacha game would dream about changing its hard pity in favour of the company because that would open a Pandora's box and make a scandal. So it is unacceptable for Papergames to expect us to just accept this, and that's why this should be our number one demand. This affects all of us, whether we are free-to-play, whales, or something in between. Even people who are spending a lot of money on Nikki would prefer to spend less, and I think I don't have to explain why standard 180 pulls pity for every 5-star outfit would be crucial to free-to-play players.

2. Our second demand should be the dyeing system. It is true that Papergames as a company needs to make money for their employees and shareholders, but we can all agree that having to pay 50 euros (or US dollars) to be able to unlock additional pallets to dye the clothes that you already had to use real money to get is unreasonable and greedy even for Papergames.

There should be standard colors for all outfits (3, 4, and 5-star outfits), including black and white colors. As we all know, white is the basis of all colors (in some amount) and cannot be considered a premium color, as Papergames would make us believe. It is 100% unacceptable not to have pure white color for 4-star outfits and not to have white color for 3-star outfits at all.

Personally, I am not against having premium currency to unlock palettes, for those who want to unlock all of them immediately, but there should be a way to unlock them using open-world materials, at least for 3 and 4-star outfits. If they are that greedy, they can gatekeep the 5-star outfits behind a paywall, but they would have to be a bit more generous with the currency and add a way for us to earn it that is sustainable. Also, the color wheel should be added to 3 and 4-star outfits if you have the whole outfit and the evolution for the 4-star outfits. If you have the whole 4-star outfit and the evolution, Papergames can't sell you anything more for that outfit, so they aren't losing anything by giving us a color wheel.

As in the case of the ""hard pity"" argument, the clothes dyeing is something that 99% of us will do at some point (or regularly) and does not affect only people who don't know how to use it. It will stay with us till the end of the game, and that is why it is important for us to demand changes.

3. The third thing would be the changes made to the intro story. This one is less important in my opinion, and I will elaborate why. In my opinion (and I have heard a lot of people sharing this opinion), the intro was only changed to explicitly promote 2 current 5-star outfits on the banners. If the new players who started the game in version 1.5 had the same intro as we all did, they would see the ""Threads of Reunion"" outfit (which is not my personal favorite but A LOT of people love it) instead of the ""Snowy Ballad"" outfit that is currently on the banner and is wearable in the new intro.

I don't think I have to explain to you why it is beneficial for Papergames to hide the ""Threads of Reunion"" and promote the two 5-star outfits currently on the banner. The question is, what are they planning after version 1.5? If they plan to keep the current intro forever (or ""moving forward"" as they like to say in their so-called apology letter), then you would have the opportunity to get those 2 5-star outfits shown the intro maybe twice a year (if we go by the assumption they are rerunning outfits every 6 months). That would be a bit ridiculous. Even more ridiculous would be the idea that there will be a new 5-star outfit or outfits (currently on the banner) in every different version of the intro instead of the present 2 5-star outfits.

It is my opinion they had the intention to only use the new intro in version 1.5 from the start. Papergames knew we would complain (a lot) about it, and they would ""give in"" to our demands and give us back the old intro in version 1.6. It would be another ""developers listened"" case. In that case, we all win; they will get to promote 2 on banner outfits for new Steam players, and we get the ""satisfaction"" of being heard.

This is why I think this isn't as important as the first two demands. If we apply logic to this question, it is perfectly clear that Papergames intended to use the new intro only in this version, and demanding of them to change something they already had the intention of changing in the first place is a bit silly and diverts the attention from the real problems (first two demands).

4. In the fourth category, I will place all the things that are, in my personal opinion, less important, if we look at the bigger picture (a gacha game that will last for years).

The game bugs, although very disruptive, are something that Papergames will fix without us having to demand it. We all know they are working actively on them in silence. So, including them in our demands will just dilute our demands and give them something to grab on to and say: ""there, we did it, we gave in to one of your demands"".

I have seen some people include the ""Swish & Stitch Soiree"" as one of the demands. I do agree, it is unreasonable to have different regions of the world having to play the event at the same time. But including this will also dilute our main demands, and looking at the bigger picture (a game that lasts for years), an event that lasts for 30 or 40 days is something a bit insignificant, unlike the first two demands that have lasting effects. Also, if the second demand is met, you wouldn't need that premium dyeing currency that much in the first place.

Demanding that the mira crown be reverted to 14 days instead of two times a month is a bit petty in my opinion, as that is the standard that most big gacha games have for their endgames. Is you ""losing"" 1800 diamonds a year (from 2 mira crowns missing) more important than having to pay 20 to 40 pulls more for every 5-star outfit instead of standard 180 pulls hard pity?

I will not list more examples, as it would make this text even longer (and it is already too long) and are also far less important than the first two demands.

\---------------------------------------------------------

If we fail to successfully carry out this boycott, Papergames will see us as ""weak women who easily give up and can be walked over"" and can apply the ""silent treatment"" (which we are currently experiencing) every time we rebel against them. That's why it is important that we all unite (together with our Chinese sisters) and demand changes. We are not demanding anything unreasonable or selfish, as the demands I listed will benefit ALL of us, and failing to accomplish them will also affect all of us.

For the end, I would like to ask all of you not to despair, as we are fighting a multi-billion-dollar company that only cares for its profit (as do all of them), and this is a long battle. Only if we are united in our solidarity and actively fighting (writing Steam and Play Store reviews, and not spending any money on the game), do we have any chance of success. Solidarity is something that is sorely missing from our present-day (some would say dystopian post-capitalistic) world and is our biggest strength in this battle.

reddit_search_1gsamv0,"Camellya is, ultimately, a tragic character 🥀 |character review|","This post is directed to those who finished her Companion Quest. Assuming you finished it and read through all the parts, let's start.

Camellya is quite an intriguing and complex character. In the surface, she just looks like another ""Rover glazer"" as some would say, but the reasons and context behind that is pretty much tragic and, to me, quite bleak, disheartening.

If we analyze her individually (without any involvement of Rover), she's a character without much purpose to her existence. Her hobbies, dreams, goals, daily life, feelings, thoughts... All that is utterly empty. She reminds me of some characters in decadent books. Camellya is, in her core, surrounded by nothingness. She battles herself constantly in the process of accepting (or rejecting, depending on what version of her) this predicament. Her identity is all over the place throughout the timelines, possibilities and existences she'd already had. 

Imagine this: she had lost everything - memories, people to shelter her, a place to be in... Then comes the Rover, someone with so much power that can reshape *FATE*. 

Camellya, being as ""fragile"" as she's always been, finally has something to hold on to, in a world where things just crumble (where she doesn't feel anything, besides her instincts and animalistic urges). That'd logically put her existence onto Rover's strength (changing the environment and situation she lives in), creating some meaning behind her actions (which were, originally, devoided of any). That's what means to be a ""seed of fate"", all the potential to make her accept the void and be ""free"", returning to her primal desires. This same ""freedom"" is constantly denied by her alter ego in the cutscenes. 

Quite melancholic. As she said in the end of the quest, all other universes in which she and Rover parted ways don't seem to exist, and both of them are fated to this cyclical union. I find it tragic because she just can't live by herself without this ""potential for existing"". She is like a parasite, needing a host to survive, to think, to feel...

Her animalistic side is an example of how simplistic desires can sometimes make us, people in real life, hold on to something harmful just to keep on surviving. That's pretty common in people with addictions and coping mechanisms that involve any kind of extreme self-indulgence (or the opposite), also seem in psychoanalytic theories for instance, like the [ego-drive/id dilemma](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4076885/), or the Jungian lexicon of possession (see anima/animus and archetypal possessions).

All-in-all, I don't think she's just a ""romantic"" sidekick for Rover. Reducing her characterization to only that aspect is ignorant, not taking account the context of her entire life. This >also< applies to those who only perceive her as an object for pleasure.

Having said all this, I actually see myself a lot on Camellya. In some parts of the quest, I was like ""omg she's just like me fr, I think the same too"", so I have a special place for her in my mind. 

Well, these are my thoughts. I have many other things to say, but this would be an entire essay by the end of it.

Feel free to share any thoughts regarding Camellya in the comments  🥀🏵️♥️

reddit_search_1dvr8p3,Review of ZZZ after grinding from the release date. (2nd day),"Hey, after experiencing ZZZ for a good amount of time. I would like to provide a review for this game base on my experience while trying to be as objective as possible.

**1. Device Performance / Optimization**

Like every other hoyoverse games, when it comes to optimization. they are doing a great job at it. I know there are some people who may not be able to play because their device doesn't match the minimum requirement. but for the devices that can run the game. from what I've heard has **relatively** very little performance issue for a game at launch. As I have only played on laptop, i will not go on too much about this section.

**2. Music**

Everyone has their own musical taste, for me ZZZ's musical style is not my favorite out of all the games (I prefer HSR's music). But throwing away all biases objectively speaking they've had done a wonderful job. Every area. scene and boss fight have great music that accompanies the game which also really fits the overall vibe of the game.

**3. Story and Gameplay (outside of combat)**

Objectively Speaking, I think ZZZ so far has told a clean story. Yes, Clean story. Not anything amazing not terrible, but does a good job establishing the setting, characters etc. I really don't think there should be much complain on this, given there is a skip button

As for the ""TV"" gameplay, i believe this is completely up to preference. Although i will say, this TV thing is likely not something they will push in the future. I believe this game play was made as sort of a filler for them to focus more on the combat aspect. (I say sort of because effort is clearly put into this)

This was mentioned by the dev's themselves in the future the TV gameplay may become fully fleshed out map

[Quote From Daiwei and ZZZ gameplay Dev \(ZZZ Pre Livestream\) ](https://preview.redd.it/iacjp4n22nad1.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f99d9963a9550bf77e638151d968adaf91178cb)

**4. Combat**

This is going to make up a big section of my post.

I've seen a lot of post saying that ZZZ Combat is boring, while some of them are haters that doom post the game/company. for me and I'm sure for others there are definitely some truths in it. It is important that players acknowledge the flaws in their own game so the game can get better.

Personally, I shared the same opinion of ZZZ combat is boring. However **up to an extent.**

I think ZZZ's combat has a lot of potential. However, to get to this point of where the combat can be fun. it takes too long. and this is what I think the biggest flaw of this game is for a lot of the player base who wants an action game.

[ZZZ's game difficulty progression](https://preview.redd.it/0b9jkaqjtmad1.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e9388fb9d917cfbaf9a66ad7784b0fc31b2967)

They are trying a bit too hard to draw the casual players in for an action game. The gameplay difficult spikes too slowly. The game difficulty i would describe using this visual representation drawn above. many people who come in with the expectation of an action game will not get out of the relatively flat line part. before they quit

(For the next part i will make a brief comparison to Wuthering Waves's combat, as this is the closest we have to compare. This is not to say WW is better than ZZZ or ZZZ is better than WW. Both have their flaws and charms)

This problem actually exists for wuthering waves as well. Overall, but why this problem doesn't show or doesn't affect the action game gamers in wuthering waves is that people have the option to challenge very hard red name elite mobs whenever. So, for people who are looking for a challenge. This allows them to skip the flat section. a lot of the mob in WW, is still. Button Mashing.

However, in ZZZ, you can't skip the button mashing part. If you are a player who is used to action games and looking for a challenge. you are forced to sit through a section of the game where ZZZ's developer aims to ""teach"" the casual players how to essentially play the game.

And don't take this from me. take it from the game developers themselves, the ""challenge mode"" is just challenge for casual players.

[Quote From ZZZ's dev talk with Street Fighter Dev \(That barely any of its player base watched\)](https://preview.redd.it/t2i46s09ymad1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d819fa62c388e53c2b9ad06bf34a79d012765f6)

(I know they said 3 lines in terms of difficulties, but I believe we have not reached the 3rd line yet as of content can be possibility covered right now, hence my graph only has 2 ""platform"" like lines)

This experience would be great for new players to action game, but for a lot of us who already has some experience in it, this game would be boring for a good part of the game. And this is a big reason for such different opinions for this game in general. Casual Players VS Action players.

But the bottom-line is, anyone that denies any problem or doom posting the game. really needs to see the other side of the story.

**5. Future of the game**

Personally, I think based on what the dev's said and Hoyoverse being a multi-billion company who has the fund to back up what they said. ZZZ's future is bright if they are able to deliver what they promised.

If they are able to produce bosses with interesting skill set, mechanics. I'm willing to say this WILL be the game of the year for mobile. ZZZ's combat design is not bad. There are a lot of combos and details to it. It's just no one have to dig into it right now. because button mashing gets you through.

However, I do have my doubt on this topic as with every action focused gatcha game. Whether its WW, ZZ, PGR you name it. How does Gatcha play into how the future of the game will look?

You make a boss easy, it's boring for whales and for F2P

You make a boss harder, very easy for whales still. not good for making money

You make a boss extremely hard; Players don't spend money than they have fun fighting the boss. very F2P non friendly.

I really do hope the game does not fall into the first and last category. But since the devs promised and has shown they do listen (Insert Meme here someone!) in beta testing. I will support this game for as long as I see there are efforts made in a reasonable timeframe when it comes to difficulty.

[Quoting Dev's from zzz pre - livestream](https://preview.redd.it/skpko1yw4nad1.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=56b042d219cb2152a3ee7df0e6e39e35cc365ff0)

**6. Final Rating for this game**

Rating in the perspective of a casual player who wants to pick up an action game, I would rate this game a 9/10, or heck even 10/10 if you enjoy the puzzle gameplay/story within the game.

Rating in the perspective of an experience action gamer (not a diehard action gamer) 6/10 for the early gameplay, and an 8/10 for the later stages as for right now.

Rating in the perspective of a diehard action gamer. Music+Art+Vibe/10 for the early game play, you can fill in the numbers base what what you think combat difficulty is non existent, 5-6/10 as of second day of content. Given you can endure the first hours of button smashing. Overall, if you enjoy hardcore gameplay. it's best to stay away from gachas.

**Final Note:**

I tried to be objective as possible in this review, however. I'm only human. I have my likings and dislikes. I may fall into bias without knowing. I'm happy to have a CIVIL discussion, thanks.",359,127,1720160423.0,ZZZ_Official,PuzzleheadedTea7484,0.86,https://reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1dvr8p3/review_of_zzz_after_grinding_from_the_release/
reddit_search_1kv2obo,POCO F7 Ultra - Full review,"Good day/night everyone. 

This is my review of the Poco F7 Ultra After 1 month of usage, and I have some things to say about this phone. 
Today, I'll try to be as detailed as possible (please note that my English is not perfect as I'm not a native English speaker, so some sentences may sound confusing), so sit back and enjoy the review. 
Also, at the end of the review, I'll give it a rating and do a Pros and Cons. 

What's in the box?: 
• 1X Poco F7 Ultra (Pre-applied Screen protector)
• 1X Silicone Case 
• 1X USB C to USB A cable 
• 1X Warrenty card

Design/Feels:
The design of the Poco F7 Ultra looks unique. 
Thanks to its Matt and Glass mix, the phone feels different from any other phone that I ever had my hands on.
Also, if you point the matt back into the direction of light, you will notice that it shines (and sometimes I was able to see some sparkles)
Compared to my Poco F3 or My Redmaic 7s Pro, the Poco F7 Ultra feels more Premium and Flagship like. 
It also doesn't Slip out of my hands unlike the Poco F3 when you hold it in different positions. 
The Poco F7 Ultra also has a metal frame, which may get really hot when doing some gaming or when the device heats up, so I recommend using the Silicone Case that got delivered with the device. 

Software/Limitations
As for the software, it has been a really good experience so far. 
It's smooth, looks unique and has amazing Looking animations.
Though, there are a few things that annoy me with the OS. 
1. There are a lot of Bugs, for example some Ai features disappeard out of nowhere (e.g. Gallery Editor or AI writing) or a buggy CC (when pressing the Bluetooth button, the whole interface crashes and sends me back to the Lockscreen). 
2. While it is good that Xiaomi is restricting users from giving random apps from the internet all permissions you can possibly give an app, it is also pretty annoying that you can't do that with apps from the Play Store. For example, WhatsApp once asked me if I could give it permission to access the camera (for a video call), it was unable to prompt me the permission I needed to give. 
Even when looking in the settings, I was unable to give it permissions since Xiaomi is restricting that. 
Even Shizuku wasn't helping me.
3. You are also almost unable to unlock the bootloader and root the device as Xiaomi is strictly limitating users to unlock the bootloader. 
As of now, you can only unlock the bootloader via the Community app. 
But as you may have expected, you cannot unlock it unless you apply for it. 
The chances of Applying for an bootloader unlock successfully is very, very low.
4. After using HyperOS 2 for over a month, I've noticed that it's not optimized. The ram usage is high and sometimes, it stutters.
5. It is really annoying that you always have to wait for 10 seconds when giving an app permission to let it download and update from their own sources. 
HyperAI also has been a pretty useful AI so far. 
You get a lot of AI features which may be useful for you too. 
So far, I've been playing around with the ai in the Gallery App, Notes app, Recorder and the Ai subtitles.
So, no issues with the AI. 

Display:
The display of the Poco F7 Ultra has also been really good so far. 
It looks crispy, has bright and colorful colors and can get really bright when you are under the sun. 
Thanks to its 2K resolution, you can view photos and videos at a resolution. Of course, it looks high quality. So I'm a fan of the display so far. 
The bezels of the Poco F7 Ultra are surprisingly thin too. While it's not as thin as other flagships, it's still more then good.
 
Performance/Gaming
The performance of the Poco F7 Ultra has been really impressive so far for me. 
The Poco F7 Ultra has a Snapdragon 8 Elite and performs like a champ. 
When playing games like Genshin impact, Honkai impact, Honkai star rail, wuthering waves, it achieved a whooping 60 fps so far for me. 
Though, I noticed that when playing Genshin impact and wuthering waves, the motion blur for example doesn't exist and the game lags when turning around quickly, which makes me wonder if it's the fault of HyperOS or the D7 chip that is inside the phone.
The ""Smart Frames"" feature is also pretty useless so far since it only lowers my fps and makes the game more stuttery instead of more smoothness. 
The Super resolution feature also has been pretty interesting so far. 
I noticed that it's only upscaling the resolution, so no native 2K resolution when playing games. 
I also did a lot of PC emulation on my phone, and I have to say that it's been really impressive so far. 
Games like resident evil 2 and resident evil 4 ran at 2K resolution and Max graphics settings at around 20-30 fps with stutters and lags. 
I also tried Miside and Exo One, which didn't had any performance issues so far. 

Battery/Battery life:
The battery of the Poco F7 Ultra has been really amazing so far.
Yes, 5300 mah may sound small, but it isn't as bad as you may think it is. 
For example, I was able to play Genshin impact in the highest graphics settings for over 3 hours or I was even able to play computer games for over 2 hours until it later died.
Thanks to its 120 Watts support though, you can easily charge it in around 30 minutes back to 100%. 
It also supports 50 watts of wireless charging in case you need that wireless charging. 

Camera:
Here comes the final part of the review. 
The camera has a triple camera layout and has 2X 50 MP 1X 32 MP and a 1X 32 MP selfie camera.  
(Here's information from gsmarena)
Main sensors:

50 MP, f/1.6, 24mm (wide), 1/1.55"", 1.0µm, multi-
directional PDAF, OIS
50 MP, f/2.0, 60mm (telephoto), 1/2.76"", 0.64µm,
multi-directional PDAF (10cm - ∞o), OIS, 2.5x
optical zoom
32 MP, f/2.2, 15mm, 120° (ultrawide), 1/3.42"", 0.64µm

Selfie camera: 32 MP, f/2.0, 24mm, (wide), 1/3.42"", 0.64µm

So far, I must say that the Camera is really good so far. 
It takes good, high quality and colorful pictures, which is impressive to me. 
The max resolution of reach camera sensor is 4K 
While the selfie camera has a max resolution of roughly 4928x6560px (Gemini says it's ""Approaching 5K"", so I'd leave it like that)

The video quality is kinda questionable though. 
While the main cameras can reach 4K 60 fps or 8K 24 fps, the Ultrawide camera can only record up to 1080P 30 fps, which is interesting to me. 
Even the selfie camera can't do more then 1080P 60 fps. 
This is not a problem for me though, but it may be a problem for other people who plans to use this phone for videos or photos. 

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Poco F7 Ultra has been a really interesting and beefy Phone. While the Poco may show it's strengths in performance and the battery life, it also shows it's weaknesses in terms of the camera and the software.

So, here's my rating:

Design: 9.5/10
Display: 9/10
Software: 7,5/10
Performance: 10/10
Gaming experience: 8,5/10
Battery life: 9/10
Camera: 8,5/10

Final Rating: 8.9/10

Pro's and Cons:

Pro: 
• Performance (Snapdragon 8 Elite)
• Battery life (e.g. Genshin impact ran for around 3 hours at highest graphics settings)
• Design looks unique and different from other phones
• D7 Chip makes games look more beautiful 
• Camera takes high quality pictures (4k resolution)
• Slim bezels
• Pre-installed Screen protector 
• loud and clear speakers

Cons: 
• Video quality limitations (e.g. selfie camera and Ultra wide camera)
• HyperOS is buggy and slightly unoptimized 
• Weird lags when doing quick movements in games
• Limitations (e.g. bootloader unlock and giving permissions to apps)
• No Esim support (may be important for some people) 
• No storage expansion support 
• No 3,5 mm headjack (should exist for people who does some serious gaming)

Anyway, thank you so much for reading through the whole review and I hope you enjoyed it. 
If there's anything missing or sounds weird, I deeply apologize for that. 

Have a great day/night!

[A Small Look at Wishfield](https://preview.redd.it/96z2oxtyq7cd1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=e28ecc3846a73b961a76b589bbf24c06d87ba7f7)

Here’s a Video in case ur not familiar with Infinity Nikki: [\~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0oiJJRZF4I&ab\_channel=PlayStation\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0oiJJRZF4I&ab_channel=PlayStation)

And a Full Playthrough of the Story: [\~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ0ViG37h98&t=12276s&ab\_channel=HamsterButtocks\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ0ViG37h98&t=12276s&ab_channel=HamsterButtocks) 

**Note**: I didn’t do everyyyyy single thing in the game---and due to technical difficulties on my end, I actually started a bit late. But I did finish the Main Story (which I feel is the Most Important Thing) and explored the entire Map and definitely have a really strong feel for the game. I also haven’t played Love Nikki / Shining Nikki / nor any other games in the Nikki-verse so I was kinda going in with No Expectations. Also, unrelated fun fact but one of the game producers for Infinity Nikki also worked on Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild! ♡(>ᴗ•)

**\~Premise\~**: You play as Nikki, a regular (?) human girl who, while exploring her attic, looking for an outfit for a graduation party, discovers a strange red dress in a wardrobe which she transforms into and then whisks her and her talking cat Momo off to a ruined castle where you meet Ena The Curator who “has been imprisoned for 1000 years, since the Heaven Fall” (no idea what ANY of that means lol). Ena says some mysterious things about ‘infinity’ and ‘destiny’ and how she used to dance with the owner of the red dress you are wearing ages ago (lesbians?!?!?!) and how you need to find the 8 Miracle Outfits to discover the Truth (“A truth that not even the Gods could uncover”), but you will end up losing something in the process. And then you wake up in an abandoned Stylist Guild HQ Building in Wishfield with Momo and discover you are a Stylist (you have Fashion Magic (Certain Outfits have Different Abilities from ‘Fighting’ to ‘Floating’ to ‘Electrician’)) and through the Heart of Infinity that Ena gifted(?) you, you can Unlock more magical Outfits and Abilities. There’s also ‘monsters’ called Esselings, which have been created from leftover Demon Essence from the Demon War which you can fight/purify using your 1 Combat Outfit (more on that later). And then you set off, dealing with a mysterious cult of religious fanatics, a 10 year missing person cold case and a series of comas (literally I am so serious, lol it’s kinda crazy lol) trying to search for a person named The Prophet who is also after the Miracle Outfit, which seems to be connected to the missing God of Wishfield, The Wishing One. The story ends before you head to the next Area/Region, Stoneville, which is said to have very different religious beliefs in contrast to Wishfield (despite the fact that the 2 Regions both worship the same god) and there seems to be some major growing tensions between the two. 

\~

# POSITIVES:

**LOVE the Aesthetic / World Design.** Gorgeous and beautiful, the world was very whimsical and fantasy, it reminded me of Studio Ghibli in a way---very Fae and mystical as well! The actual World Design in particular was very well designed and crafted, with multiple stand-out stunning areas of such beauty and immaculately created with such attention to detail, plus very diverse too! From a spooky forest with a strange church to flower fields to an art academy to a ruined castle to a border outpost with refugees to a lakeside harbor to abandoned camps of religious fanactics----they are clearly thinking about the world they are creating! Really really amazing. My fave area? Swan Gazebo! 

**Graphics were Exquisite!!!** I really felt immersed, running through the forests and fields and waterfalls. Lends itself to picture taking and really makes you feel like you are really There, in Wishfield

[OH WOW](https://preview.redd.it/olspu9w5r7cd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0c750f0a74bf7a124e24f38022b97d3e81a8f38)

**Surprisingly Really Great Lore and Worldbuilding**?!??! It’s a lot to get into but there’s more than 6000 Years of History, a Demon War from 1000 Years ago, a power hungry Empire of Light trying to conquer the other nations (poor Umbraso), a refuge crisis on the border (Umbraso), ‘The Eight’ legendary Stylists (basically Fashion Wizards) who helped establish the modern day magic system and created The 6 Nations (Heartcraft Kingdom (where the journey starts), Leylang Empire to the North, Starhail Federation to the East, Empire of Light to West, Twinmoon Kingdom and the Terra Alliance even further to the West). Not to mention that there are ‘Religions’ based around certain Ancient Stylists, like The Society of the Observer who believe that Styling derives from Observation. And there are Gods too, like The Wishing One (but the Gods seem to be MIA it seems? Or at least The Wishing One is/dead(?)). I knew Love Nikki had some pretty deep and intense lore and story and worldbuilding but even I was kinda blown away!

[Future Countries](https://preview.redd.it/bxd5gg2ir7cd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce84e6c079ea6b9ed81acfac3d0c1b52ad8593b3)

**Love the Dungeons!** There’s only 2 at the moment, the Frog Power Plant Sewers in the Well of Fortune and the Dream Warehouse Origami Crane Castle but they were really super cool! Plus, they were pretty easy to understand and navigate---sometimes dungeons can be super confusing and hard to understand (and kinda boring, most Dungeons I feel end up being just like basic and dark dilapidated ruins lol) but these ones were not only exceptionally beautiful and unique (especially the Dream Warehouse!!) but straightforward in execution. I will never forget flying the Origami Crane in the Dream Warehouse over the fields of the paper dreams. (っ˘ω˘ς )

[One of the Dungeons in the Game](https://preview.redd.it/xc7h486nr7cd1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2d816949b5c4342d9b1e966b163ade9e74b9a19)

Needless to say, the **Story was Pretty Good**--and even heartwarming (Nonoy expressing her frustrations about her adoption and how her Mom doesn’t want her to look for her birth parents) and even funny at some points (Giroda ‘pretending’ that he dueled and captured the Wish Envoy). I won’t necessarily say Great….because like…..this is still CBT 1 and it often takes stories a bit to Get Going and Get Happening. Plus, it was super clear to me that the actual full 1.0 Release will come with more story, in the next Region of Stoneville (so rating the story rn is kinda hard, it would be like critiquing the Wuthering story without having fought Scar, or the Genshin story without having gone to Stormterror’s Lair). But it had a good balance imo of Character Driven and Plot Driven. In addition, Nikki was much more proactive and even smart / clever when figuring things out and dealing with the story conflicts than I had expected. There were also some genuinely touching moments between Nikki and Nonoy, one of the major characters of the Story. It was a cute, and a good start! It feels like a story that will get more dark and intense as it keeps going (much like the Love Nikki story (#Lunar)

[Foreshadowing?!?!??!!?](https://preview.redd.it/3np1mhtsr7cd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=497ce89be561e9695b0036bc73882bee00883ae2)

**LOVE the Dresses!!!! AND BEING ABLE TO MIX AND MATCH THE DRESSES?!?!** Incredible. Being able to have the Hat from One Outfit but the Coat from Another Outfit but the Dress from Another Outfit and the Necklace from Another Outfit and the Veil from Another Outfit…….ugh. The possibilities were endless! Infinite even? ;) 

(get it? Infinite? Infinity Nikki? please laugh)

**Giovanni was Hot.** 

Personally, I **did Not encounter any Bugs nor Glitches nor Performance Issues,** so that’s a major plus! 

**The Photography Mode was so Detailed** and had so many different features, different lighting, different poses, different editing features…. definitely a highlight--and perfect for taking picture perfect pictures of the Dresses you collect. 

**Momo was so Fricking cute and funny**---but not at all overbearing (I honestly wished he talked more! and was more involved lol--(I can't believe I want the Mascot Character to be more involved but I really loved him!)

[Nikki and Momo Interrogate a Criminal](https://preview.redd.it/w9t35pr0s7cd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6dddff01d4d02ec00c18e55b1ffc705aa5406e8e)

**Voice Acting was AMAZING.** CBT 1 was only available in CN but I was kinda taken aback by the level of emotion and personality and work that was put in the VA work. Kudos to the Frog Voice Actors + the Wish Envoy + Giroda + Ena The Curator, they Frickening killed it.  

**Music was Really Good.** I usually don’t notice music in games, but this time---I noticed it. And it was really beautiful! Perfectly befitting for charming and fairytale like Wishfield.

[Please Fix these Things! \(｡•́︿•̀｡\)](https://i.redd.it/pvclt5vas7cd1.gif)

However, **the ‘Combat’ (if you can even call it that?) SUCKS**. Here is an example of what the Combat in Infinity Nikki is like:

[\~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki-mhWa4uh8&ab\_channel=GamerCorner\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki-mhWa4uh8&ab_channel=GamerCorner) 

This is Bad. 

**BAD**.

I get that Infinity Nikki is supposed to be Fun and Casual and Light Hearted and Chill and like a Girly Open World Story / Puzzle / Exploration focused kinda game. But like……..they can do better. MUCH BETTER. 

**Genshin Impact, Legend of Zelda & Pokemon are some of the most successful games on the market and have actually really deep and in depth and fun combat systems**---different Elements/Types, Weaknesses, Abilities, Talents, Weapons, Reactions, etc etc.---yet also are still very Casual and Newbie Friendly and Not Very Intense At All persay. Just because Infinity Nikki is a Fashion Game doesn’t mean it can’t and shouldn’t have some really fun and beautiful and interesting Combat! \\(★ω★)/

I **feel like Infinity Nikki could really amp up the Combat and still cater and still appeal to a more Casual market.** And the combat that does exist in the game rn, while not much, is interesting with a major focus on Positioning and Aiming, with even an interesting Plunging ability you can utilize. It just needs some major major additions to take it to The Next Level.

Plus---and I’ve talked about this a lot with my fashion obsessed little sister (who unfortunately didn’t get into the CBT)--- **Combat Can be Beautiful!** My sis loves Genshin, Wuthering Waves, even Tower of Fantasy---the cool animations and visual SFX are an Art in it of themselves. One of my sister’s favorite anime is Angelic Layer which is ALL about pretty girls with gorgeous outfits having intense hand to hand fights. & I mean, look at magical girl anime like Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Madoka, etc etc etc? There 100000% is a way to easily interweave beautiful artsy intense magical combat with the beautiful artsy and fashionable game of Infinity Nikki. 

Not to mention, if they have even a modicum of Genshin/Pokemon level combat intensity, you can open up Infinity Nikki to a whole slew of more people and really Expand the Target Audience. I feel like a lot of people on r/GachaGaming, or just Casual Gamers, would be sooo much more willing to try out and play Infinity Nikki if the Combat was greatly expanded on. **“Pretty Girls in Pretty Dresses Fighting with Pretty Magic? With Awesome and Cool and Beautiful Animations and Visual Effects? AND an actually Fun and Interesting and In Depth Combat System? Sign me up!!!”** 

And the combat doesn’t even need to be necessarily hard-----it just has to be fun and interesting! \^,\^

So IMO **Infinity Nikki could---and should!---have Different Elements, Elemental Weaknesses, Skills, Bursts, Talents, ‘Weapons’, Elemental Reactions, Intro/Outro Skills, and more.** Why not? I feel like the Combat could also be very Fashion-y / Artsy, emphasizing the game’s style and aesthetic ★★★

Now granted, it would be really Frickening hard to have Combat Abilities for Every Single Dress-- hence why I feel like Combat should be Limited to only the 5 Star Dresses (and maybe like 8 or so Freebie Combat Dresses, so that people can get a Taste of it and have some options without even Wishing). Plus, **if the Limited 5 Star Outfits and Dresses HAVE some form of Combat Gameplay Mechanic Ability (or even some Exploration themed gimmick), then people will be soo much more likely to Wish for them and get them.** “This dress is stunningggg….and the Starry Night themed combat animations are gorgeous! And it’s a Haute Couture Lilac Main DPS---just what I need!” ----us in the future, ideally.

***So, if it were up to me, I would have:***

--For the **Elements, maybe 8?**, for each of The Eight legendary Stylists (& ideally NOT ‘Elements’ like Fire/Water/Nature/Etc, but instead based on like cool Fashion Concepts & Styles, something more High Level and Abstract and Vogue). 

--**Elemental Weaknesses & Advantages a la Pokemon / Star Rail** 

--**Elemental Reaction System** (but something like Cool and Artsy and Fashiony and Easy to Understand…….and Balanced too! (we don’t need no Superconduct tier Reactions lol)). 

-**-8 ‘Weapon’ Classes; but I use the word ‘Weapons’ very loosely.** I feel like ‘Weapons’ should exist in a way since Weapons can also be Beautiful (and I’ve seen that Shining Nikki has actually some gorgeous Swords and Weapons in some of their Fashion Set Pieces), but should be more High Concept that ‘Sword’ or ‘Bow’ or ‘Claymore’ lol, something that allows for supreme creativity and infinite possibilities, not limited to just 5 Weapon Types like other games. My Little Sister LOVES Tower of Fantasy because she lovesss all the creative Weapons, from fighting with Shoes to Fans to Flowers to Claymores to Bows to Flutes; Cool Weapons leads to Cool Gameplay / Animations) So maybe the 'Weapons' should be more akin to Classes/Paths, but with a fun and Fashion-y twist!

--And y**ou can Equip up to like say 5 different Combat Outfits.** 

It will be a tough balancing act, between making Combat like Easy to Play & Understand & Casual Friendly but also really Deep and Exciting and filled with Infinite Possibilities----but I think they can pull it off! I know they can! (´･ᴗ･ \` )

[I wore a Different Outfit for Every Quest I did lol](https://preview.redd.it/mndxql0is7cd1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=405457d481599bae194f7517e7f848a0c60661a6)

**Let us Dye the Dresses!!!** I know that you are able to Dye Dresses in Shining Nikki, so I am fairly confident that it will also be a Feature in Infinity Nikki but Dyeing is such a fun mechanic that would provide SOOOOOOO much creativity and infinite potential :D

**Kilo sucks and he needs a better Model,** ASAP. Honestly Kilo looks like a mix of [Sisu ](https://rayaandthelastdragon.fandom.com/wiki/Sisu?file=Disney_Sisu.png)from Raya and the Last Dragon and the [Starlian ](https://barbiemovies.fandom.com/wiki/Starlian?file=Starlian.png)from Barbie Star Light Adventure. The face is just…….alll wrong. Please fix!

[His face looks SO weird. And is he wearing a Scarf....made of his own body?!?!?!](https://preview.redd.it/j5to8jzqs7cd1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5ab27fb06c183d4a1ee1dfdce79391a653a7dee)

While Nikki is not a Silent and Passive Main Character in the slightest, **she doesn’t ask as many Questions as she really should,** nor is she really all that troubled by being whisked off to this magical world (which I get, Miraland seems great!(ish). But still, I was waiting for her to ask someone---anyone---about who tf this ‘Ena The Curator’ is, AKA the person that sent her to Miraland in the first place? And….it never happens. How hard is it for her to ask a couple people and have them be like: “Who? No idea who that is.” or even: “Oh, Ena is a minor goddess that was believed to have died during the Demon War.” boom. 1 sentence, problem solved.

I understand the game is supposed to be light hearted, so Nikki can’t really be like ‘sad’/really missing her home and her family and her friends, but at the very least, I feel like Nikki should be a bit more confused and Asking More Questions about the Gods and the Miracle Outfits and the other Nations and etc. 

How do Giroda and Nonoy know each other??? When we meet Giroda, it seems like the two have met before and know each other, but it isn’t really explained how or why at all. 

Would love for the Dungeons to become like ‘Settlements’ where we can do Quests in, in the future. A lot of times Dungeons just are…..there, after you clear them. And that can be fine for like Some Ancient Ruin, but in Infinity Nikki, one of the Dungeons is home to a group of talking Frogs (ribbit) and the other is the Warehouse of All the Wishes of Wishfield, managed by Nonoy and her Mom. It would make sense for there to be more Quest/Story content in such areas in the future. The **Dungeons could stand to be a bit bigger,** too!

[Wishfield has Refugee Rights](https://preview.redd.it/l494ten2t7cd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=813b8018f58610e7f59a9da467d9bc9ea54bb834)

**Make ‘Commissions’ Super Easy**---the easier the Daily Grind is, the more People will Play your Game! If it takes like 30 minutes, even 10 minutes, to finish the Daily Commissions, people are going to dread doing them and grinding them out every day and will get burnt out really easily. However, if the Commissions can be be done in like 5 minutes or less, people will keep on playing ad infinitum because then they can just Log In, Knock Them Out and then Log Out. It prevents people from getting Burnt Out---and for a game that is aiming for the Casual Market, having the Grind/Commissions be As Easy As Possible will be really great---and will keep People Playing, even over a Hyper Long Term. 

**More Style Battles plz!!!**!! In Love Nikki and Shining Nikki, Style Battles are the bread and butter of the game, where you ‘fight’ against Stylists by creating Outfits, usually tied to a certain Theme/Aesthetic. In the Main Story there is only………….1 Style Battle. I was shocked! We have all these Outfits and Clothes and Dresses, let us fight it out in Style Battles and prove our mettle and get creative!

[This is my Casual 'Bout to Descend into the Sewers and Fix the Town's Electrical Power Plant' Dungeon Outfit](https://preview.redd.it/4x3g2cdbt7cd1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bcfed7d850cb572fca5be1384b7e9b53c4a677)

Society of Observer Exemplars could be much better. Basically, they’re a Religious Group dedicated to The Observer, who believed that Styling could only be understood through Observation. And they have a church in the woods and there are a series of quests you can do to charge up their Compass, which can be used to get ‘Exemplars’ which are certain holy relics. However, You The Player, never actually do any actual searching for the Exemplars and they are always found Off-Screen by a NPC (Joia ribbit) which is kinda boring AF. **I love the idea of doing like ‘Religious Quests’ for Factions (LOVE Faction Quests) but they could be a Longer & More Intricate and Interesting;** let us actually help out in the search for the Exemplars please!

**EVERY SINGLE DRESS WE SEE should be Wearable!!!! (yes even NPC / Item Dresses).** I saw multiple Dresses that NPCs were wearing, or that were in the windows of the Clothing Shops or on the racks in the Boutiques that I was like OOooo I would love to wear that! But they weren’t available :( 

So I want as many outfits to be wearable as possible! °˖✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧˖°

**Outfit Switching needs to be Optimized; allow us to Turn It Off.** Basically when you use the Floating Ability you Switch Automatically into the Floating Ability Dress; this happens for all the Abilities (you want to brush the Dog? You Switch Automatically into the Animal Tamer Outfit. You want to Fight? You Switch Automatically into the Wind Combat Outfit). Which is fine at first, but later on when you get More and More Dresses, and start Mixing and Matching and Creating Your Own Special Look, it gets annoying when you just Float for a little bit or Fight for a bit and your Beautiful Dress that you spent minutes (ok. hours.) fine tuning is now gone for a bit. It switches back, after like a minute, but I wish there was Toggle to turn the Automatic Outfit Switching On/Off. I know that there may be like Model conflicts and visual tearing but like…if I want to fix the Power Plant in my beautiful Blue and Gold Star Veil Dress, then let me. If I want to fight in my gorgeous Blue Butterfly Crystal Dress, then let me please

[Yes, that is a Giant Origami Crane Plan in the background. And Yes, you Can Ride it. ](https://preview.redd.it/54sssfrlt7cd1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=7154134265982516d85c667c5fccc683371eb2af)

**Make Co Op Available Super Duper Early!!!!!** I play Genshin, TOF and Wuthering with my little brother and sister. And we love playing together in Co Op……..but soooo many of these games lock off Co Op till like so late in the game. And for why? We want to be able to play together and see each others worlds and do the story together and quest together and explore together and fight together. So I would love to have at least 1 game where Co Op is unlocked as soon as possible please!!! Let us play with our friends and family!  (\*˘︶˘\*).｡.:\*♡

[**Love Nikki + Shining Nikki Outfits should be added!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** There are just SO SOOOOOO many awe inspiring, jaw dropping, inspiring, TRUE works of ABSOLUTE ART in those games that 120000% deserve to be in Infinity Nikki.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/lovenikki/images/0/07/The_Dragon_Pearl_unposed.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20230411202656) Attacthed are 2 of my FAVE Love Nikki & Shining Nikki Outfits---there are so many great ones, it was hard to choose! Plus, from a business standpoint, people [that paid $$$ to get those dresses in the other games will of course be just as likely to drop $$$ to get them in Infinity Nikki #Collect Them All ](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shining-nikki/images/c/c2/Godfall_Omens_Promo.png/revision/latest?cb=20240629135146)

The **Outfit System should be AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE** plz. There are some Clothing Items that don’t really conflict with one another model-wise, but because you can only wear 1 Clothing Item per Clothing Section, it prevents you from wearing like 6 different Necklaces---even if they don’t overlap with one another, modelwise. So I think the System could be liberalized a little bit, so you can wear like 4 headpieces, provided they don’t conflict with each other.

**Map should Zoom out more.**

**Nikki should be able to get her own House in Wishfield** and decorate it. Having a ‘home’ where The Player lives makes the game so much more immersive, making it really feel like you inhabit and live in the world. Plus, it would lend itself really well to the cutesy Stardew Valley/Harvest Moon esque vibe that the game seems to be going for

[One of my Favorite Dresses in the Game!](https://preview.redd.it/ywhxglpju7cd1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=261d5d97ca31455e4aefba2180823b82a0c882a2)

**Teleport Waypoints should be Marked on the Map, even if they are not yet Unlocked**. For some reason, they are not, unlike other games. Example: I was exploring the Fanactic Wisher Camp, and was like Wow, guess there’s no Teleport Waypoint over here. Only to return later on in the game and discover that there was one, but Teleport Waypoints aren’t Marked on the Map until you Discover them, which makes the Game much harder and anti-casual friendly. In addition, there should be More Teleport Waypoints as well.

**Please No Outfit Bundles**. In Shinking Nikki and Love Nikki, I believe there are Outfit Bundles where you can spend like, say, 100 dollars, to outright Buy an Outfit. I don’t really like this; I would want All Outfits to be Obtainable from the Gacha, at the very least, to make things more accessible. I want to have as much of the fashions as possible! ☆\*:.｡.o(≧▽≦)o.｡.:\*☆

**Ability / Miracle Outfits should be Renamed.** Right now, the Outfits with Abilities are called….Ability Outfits. And the legendary Dresses created by the Gods are called…Miracle Outfits. I think these names are kinda basic lol and could be made into something SO much cooler!

**The More Story Factions, the Merrier!:** So This is more of a generalized ‘Want’, but in regards to the Story: One of my favorite gacha stories is Star Rail’s for it’s heavy focus on different Factions, all consisting of different beliefs and ideologies as they clash and fight and vy for more and more power and influence. I think great stories often utilize diverse Factions to a heavy extent and I think Infinity Nikki definitely could and should invoke this in their own Main Story ; having different Factions related to the Gods and the Nations and The Eight, all fighting to claim the legendary and all-powerful Miracle Outfits, for their own agendas (granted they might be building up this already, I mean this is still like the 1st Region after all hahhaa). Maybe this will end up happening in Stoneville, the next part of the Story, but I figured I should mention it here---the sooner it happens, the better. 

[Jesus Allegory](https://preview.redd.it/2og4b55ru7cd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78022317a363534531b1598b3769b54fff5d1a1e)

**No Climbing or Swimming??!?!??!** Despite the fact that Infinity Nikki IS an Open World--and a Beautiful one at that---it falls short on the whole ‘Exploring’ aspect as You are unable to Swim or Climb, which greatly greatlyyyy restricts freedom of exploration. It makes sense, since there are some puzzles that can only work if you can’t Climb or Swim, but it still is really reallyyy annoying. But this can be easily remedied---maybe in the next Chapter, you get a Swimming & Climbing Outfit, enabling you to Swim and Climb. Boom! Problem Solved! :)

**Easy Gacha**: I guess the last thing, but maybe the most pivotal, is an easy gacha and generous gacha system. There was no Gacha at all really in CBT 1, but this is obviously going to be a Gacha game and will be a major component. The more generous a gacha system is, the better ! Granted, it is of course a balancing act of profit vs generosity. But, in the words of my sister: “More People will Play the Game...........the More Characters they can Get.” My lil brother, sis and I have been loving Wuthering Waves which has been so extremely generous with in giving out freebies and we have been able to pretty easily nab all the characters we want. So making a rewarding and generous and fair gacha will Encourage People to Play----and Keep them Playing too!

[Sunrise of the Last Day of the CBT](https://preview.redd.it/k8l7x26wu7cd1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b775055b7bdce9cb9009817b58bed5841614246)

# Conclusion:

I really loved Infinity Nikki! On a scale from 0--100, I would probably give it a **86**! Whenever I play a CBT game, I always think: “If this Game was Released Right Now, As Is, With NO Changes, would it do Well?” and for Infinity Nikki, I think defo Yes! It’s very different and it carves a very unique niche for itself in the Gacha Market. However, if it implemented even just some of the changes I’ve suggested (mostly just the Combat critique tbh lol), then I think Infinity Nikki would easily be a Top 5 Gacha Game, up there with Genshin, Star Rail, Wuthering, etc. 

Honestly, playing Infinity Nikki was very oddly nostalgic and charming for me (I will never forget running around Wishfield and doing quests in my many manyyyyy beautiful Dresses while listening to Italian music). I think it could really be a Smash Hit---and could open the door for even more Open World Dress Up Gacha Games in the future.

Honestly digging around in various discord servers, omitting timestamps, taking messages out of context all so they can prop her up as the next target and witch hunt her is absolutely ridiculous. I've known Maygi for the past 3 years, what many of you do not see is how things happen in private circles behind closed doors, and yes she does occasionally vent about how she feels on things, Heck She shits on basically every game out there as well for various different things, nothing is perfect. She's been attacked by the rabid community many times in the past for making any form of criticism on things, another thing you guys may not have known as well is that She actually hasn't been given Access nor NDA's to help her make content on WuWa since around 1.3, There have also been many mismanagement with the creator manager for Wuthering waves as well resulting in her occasionally. Heck she regularly sends them her own content to review every patch. They allowed her to post what she did but hey let's take everything out of context and hide everything from view.
