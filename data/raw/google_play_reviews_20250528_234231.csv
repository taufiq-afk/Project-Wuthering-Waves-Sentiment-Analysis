779e3d28-45ca-4e28-93c3-c4ad51bfe4d6,先說說優點。第一，這個遊戲戰鬥很爽，角色動作豐富炫酷，能閃避，還能彈刀。怪物攻擊還很頻繁，不是站著不動給你打。可以秀出很帥的操作，可以說是二遊巔峰的打鬥。第二，女角色建模很美，還很色（你細品）。缺點方面，第一，鳴潮用的是和米哈遊一樣的卡池。這就很噁心，很不公平。憑什麼有的人三四十抽就出；有的人累死累活一百六十抽才出，這是身心的雙重打擊。我第一金74抽歪了雪豹，然後大保底出了菲比。我的帳號像被詛咒了，後面的每次，每次，限定卡池都在大保底歪。你問我為什麼不換一個新號？沒時間從新肝。我玩了半年，只出了三個限定角色。如果卡池有補償機制，我也不至於退遊。第二，庫洛的審美很差，很多角色的衣服（特別是四星角色）很醜，很土。要知道，二遊就是賣角色，你角色衣服和皮膚醜，（我的推柯萊塔新皮膚下半身是什麼鬼，太空了，跟四星一樣）我也沒慾望抽和買。第三，前半部的劇情真的挺普通，甚至是尷尬，頭皮發麻，全都是謎語人。不過，自從黎娜希塔之後的劇情就越來越好看，特別是最新的那段和大卡的巔峰打戲。總之，庫洛你好好琢磨卡池補償機制吧，別走米哈遊的老路。,2,2025-05-27 15:54:43,google_play,0,465

Everything from story to characters to game play is literally THE best. but I have only one query. can you increase the amount of members in one team? like 3 in one team is good but it would be more convenient if it's 4 instead of 3. Just a request because if it becomes 4 then it would be more fun to play as I can use another one of my 5 star character,5,2025-05-19 21:53:53,google_play,0,440
