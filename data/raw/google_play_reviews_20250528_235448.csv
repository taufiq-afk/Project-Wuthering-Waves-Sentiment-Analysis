779e3d28-45ca-4e28-93c3-c4ad51bfe4d6,先說說優點。第一，這個遊戲戰鬥很爽，角色動作豐富炫酷，能閃避，還能彈刀。怪物攻擊還很頻繁，不是站著不動給你打。可以秀出很帥的操作，可以說是二遊巔峰的打鬥。第二，女角色建模很美，還很色（你細品）。缺點方面，第一，鳴潮用的是和米哈遊一樣的卡池。這就很噁心，很不公平。憑什麼有的人三四十抽就出；有的人累死累活一百六十抽才出，這是身心的雙重打擊。我第一金74抽歪了雪豹，然後大保底出了菲比。我的帳號像被詛咒了，後面的每次，每次，限定卡池都在大保底歪。你問我為什麼不換一個新號？沒時間從新肝。我玩了半年，只出了三個限定角色。如果卡池有補償機制，我也不至於退遊。第二，庫洛的審美很差，很多角色的衣服（特別是四星角色）很醜，很土。要知道，二遊就是賣角色，你角色衣服和皮膚醜，（我的推柯萊塔新皮膚下半身是什麼鬼，太空了，跟四星一樣）我也沒慾望抽和買。第三，前半部的劇情真的挺普通，甚至是尷尬，頭皮發麻，全都是謎語人。不過，自從黎娜希塔之後的劇情就越來越好看，特別是最新的那段和大卡的巔峰打戲。總之，庫洛你好好琢磨卡池補償機制吧，別走米哈遊的老路。,2,2025-05-27 15:54:43,google_play,0,465

The lore feels too shallow, and while companion stories help a little, they aren’t enough. What really disappointed me is the lack of balance in character representation—it feels overly focused on female characters, which made the experience feel less inclusive. I had high hopes, but it’s starting to feel like just another pretty gacha game for male audience",4,2025-05-23 12:31:26,google_play,3,500

Just for it to turn into yet another waifu gathering game. the world feels incomplete, somehow only women seem to exist in it. meanwhile male characters drop once a year and are completely irrelevant to the story. the post-apocalyptic setting seems to have been completely brushed aside too lol. Characters and story are poorly written and have no depth to them at all. every version i hope for change, but they only seem to ""listen"" to male players.

The farming is good but could use some improvements such as increasing the weekly boss limit. The balancing of characters is fair and doesn't give off any p2w vibes as crucial features aren't locked behind dupes and actually are in the base kit.

c9b30e90-f06e-4434-8c02-af72667c34c4,Good game play. Nice story teller. Graphic is very good for mobile game level but does not support some laptop GPUs. The gacha rate is normally bad and understandable. If they remove 50/50 pity's rate that should be better. Normally you should get a 5 star banner character within 160 pulls(80 guarantee drop 2 times). Don't expect too much for a F2P player. Just play and enjoy your life. Another good thing is this game reminds you that you spend too much time in the game and should rest.,4,2025-04-30 06:37:25,google_play,0,491

But if there's one thing I want to point out is that I wish to see characters interacting with each other even more rather than the player. I want see the depths of the relationship with them and the others. For example the Black Shores, I want to see Shorekeeper and Camellya interacting with each other in the game. The same goes with Carlotta and Cantarella. I want them to at least have a go on each other (a fight). But anyway the game is good.",5,2025-04-29 05:10:15,google_play,1,495

f1e4b712-e5c0-4723-8762-f06b57bcffa4,This is my favorite Open world game. I enjoy playing this game. But please give us high chance of getting a high crit. rate or crit dmg in rolling sub stat in echo. It so hard to build a strong resonator. I spend a lot of exp. for echo and tuner but still it's so seldom to get a crit rate or dmg. That's why I can't build a strong resonator . And please give a higher chance of drop rate to acquire an echo boss with crit rate and crit dmg.,2,2025-04-28 20:22:42,google_play,0,441

I hope devs always continue to love the game and continue making improvements. I liked the celebratory mood rather than the usual gacha games money making approach. I think new features will really feel rewarding. I don't care much about rewards because devs really make us feel that we are celebrating the anniversary.
